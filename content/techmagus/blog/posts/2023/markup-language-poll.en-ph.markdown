I mostly use {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}}, but I have also been considering learning {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Org-mode{{% /quote %}}. Other than {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}}, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Org-mode{{% /quote %}}, and good old plaintext—which is not a markup language per se—there are also {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}AsciiDoc{{% /quote %}} and {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}LaTeX{{% /quote %}}, to mention two. I was curious if it is worth learning a new markup language, and what other people use. Was it easy for them to learn a new markup language? Are they using it for writing research papers, blogging, emails, and taking down notes?

No better way to find out other than by making a poll and asking the fediverse community!

## What are people saying?

For {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Fell{{% /quote %}}'s thesis, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}LaTeX{{% /quote %}} is the markup language of choice, but in all other cases, good old plaintext is more than enough because it is compatible with everything.

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_brown" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Fell" srclink="https://ma.fellr.net/@fell/110129025350721173" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="" attriblink="https://ma.fellr.net/@fell" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
I'm using [#texlatex](https://ma.fellr.net/tags/texlatex) for my [#thesis](https://ma.fellr.net/tags/thesis) but I try to stick to [#plaintext](https://ma.fellr.net/tags/plaintext) in all other cases, simply because it's compatible with everything.
{{% /quotebox %}}

I agree. Plaintext is plaintext. It is the easiest and fastest way to take down notes. You do not have to worry about converting a particular file from one markup language to another.

However, for {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Nick Anderson{{% /quote %}}, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Org-mode{{% /quote %}} is life. {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Nick{{% /quote %}} uses {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Org-mode{{% /quote %}} for everything: knowledge management, writing email, blogging, presentations, tracking time, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Jira{{% /quote %}} ticketing, and more. {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Nick{{% /quote %}}'s entire workflow and daily routine, you can guarantee {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Org-mode{{% /quote %}} is there.

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_brown-medium-dark" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Nick Anderson" srclink="https://fosstodon.org/users/nickanderson/statuses/110129558959280943" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="" attriblink="https://fosstodon.org/@nickanderson" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
I'm using org-mode. The markup itself was not difficult at all, basics in no time but it's a never ending process of tweaking my system and methodologies. https://cmdln.org/2023/03/13/reflecting-on-my-history-with-org-mode-in-2023/

I use it for everything, or as much as I can, including knowledge management, writing email, blogging, jira ticketing,  presentations, encrypted secrets, tracking time and more. If I'm doing something (especially text oriented) it comes back and touches [#emacs](https://fosstodon.org/tags/emacs)  [#orgmode](https://fosstodon.org/tags/orgmode) in some way. https://cmdln.org/2023/03/25/how-i-org-in-2023/
{{% /quotebox %}}

I checked the articles {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Nick{{% /quote %}} shared, and after going through {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Nick{{% /quote %}}'s experience and process, I can imagine how it made {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Nick{{% /quote %}}'s daily workflow faster and easier. This is a good thing, as I have mentioned I have been considering learning {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Org-mode{{% /quote %}} and integrating it into my daily routine.

For {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Evan Keeton{{% /quote %}}, the answers are {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}LaTeX{{% /quote %}} and {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}} markup languages. {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Evan{{% /quote %}} shared that for anything mathematics related, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}LaTeX{{% /quote %}} is the one to use. This is true, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}LaTeX{{% /quote %}} is the choice in publishing scientific documents [^latex-de-facto]. If you plan to publish a research paper, it is a good idea to master {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}LaTeX{{% /quote %}}.

[^latex-de-facto]: [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) (retrieved: 2023-04-10) (archive: [1](https://web.archive.org/web/20230410000143/https://www.latex-project.org/) [2](https://archive.md/lQ8SN))

However, for things like note-taking, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Evan{{% /quote %}} said that {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}} fits perfectly. For {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Evan{{% /quote %}}, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}} is easy to read even without a proper renderer. I can attest to that. As a long-time {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}} user, my mind processes a {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}} document as if my brain is a {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}} renderer. It flows naturally, I do not have to consciously think about the markups in the document.

In undergrad, I’m only using two for a couple of different purposes:

[#latex](https://apobangpo.space/tags/latex) for anything mathematical-related, and many of my formal assignments in general (once you pick up basic formatting, it’s really easy to get started and make something nice)

[#markdown](https://apobangpo.space/tags/markdown) for things more along the lines of notes. I use it in my personal life as well as taking notes for class, since it’s so easy to read even without a proper Markdown renderer

{{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Potung Thul{{% /quote %}} shares the same view as {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Fell{{% /quote %}}, plaintext is the most compatible format of all the choices in the poll. {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Vim{{% /quote %}} is also {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Potung{{% /quote %}}'s go to cross-platform software for editing texts.

I have text on a variety of devices: desktop, laptop, smartphone
I used plaintext because it is the most compatible between them.
I use Vim on all of the devices.

## Closing

From the above poll, while not conclusive, it gave a general overview on which format, or markup language, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}fediverse{{% /quote %}} citizens use. The top two are: {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}} and {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Org-mode{{% /quote %}}, followed by plaintext. While {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}LaTeX{{% /quote %}} is the de facto choice for scientific publications and in other fields [^latex-de-facto].

I have heard good things about {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}AsciiDoc{{% /quote %}}, though it only received a few votes in this poll, it is a markup language that one should consider. It may be easier for you compared to the other popular choices.

Should you try one of these markup languages? Yes, you definitely should. {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}} is common in software development, for example, it is the markup language used by web repository services like {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Codeberg{{% /quote %}} [^codeberg]. It is also the default in many static-site generators like {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Hugo{{% /quote %}} [^hugo]. There are also forum software which allow {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Markdown{{% /quote %}} editing other than the old {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}BBcode{{% /quote %}} format.

[^codeberg]: [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org)
[^hugo]: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)

And as was mentioned, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}LaTeX{{% /quote %}} is the de facto standard in <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics">STEM</abbr> (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) publishing. Authors can submit their papers as a {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}LaTeX{{% /quote %}} document, and the publishers converts it to their own preferred format without losing any text information, like bold, italics, images, and footnotes. Compare that to submitting PDF, ODF, and DOCX documents, more likely than not the publisher will have to check if the conversion was accurate. Or, the authors of the paper have to spend more time on these things when they can better spend it doing research and experiments.

Of course, plaintext is as good as any. If presentation is not important, like bold and italics, plaintext can fill our everyday needs in documentation and note-taking. Even before the age of computers, that is what we were already doing… writing down in plaintext.
