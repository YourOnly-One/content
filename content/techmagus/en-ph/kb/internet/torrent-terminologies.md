We all use the bittorrent protocol, anyone who claims they do not download anything "torrent" is probably someone from the 90s or possibly from the future where a new technology replaced it. For example, if you are playing World of Warcraft then you are getting the game patches via the bittorrent protocol, because **Blizzard**'s game launcher uses this technology.

Bittorrent is a type of peer-to-peer network. It is not "evil" as some groups are trying to paint it to be. Even in films, there are those that actually encourage the piracy of their material or more exactly, the sharing of their production via torrent. Mainly to show that this piece of technology is neutral.

As someone who downloads materials via the bittorrent network, we have all seen those acronyms or lingo used in this space. Here are some terminologies and acronyms you will find and probably have encountered already when searching for a new torrent show to download.

## Pre-release

- **WP** means <i>Workprint</i>. It is a copy that is not yet finished but already released for public consumption. It can be missing music and scenes. The quality ranges from poor to excellent.

- **SCR** or <i>Screener</i> is a promotional pre-VHS tape usually sent to rental stores.
- **TC** for <i>Telecine</i>, a film-to-tape or film-to-digital copy. The quality is generally comparable to a DVD copy.
- **R5**, short for <i>DVD Region 5</i>. Often lack image post-processing and special features common to a traditional/normal scheduled DVD releases.
- **R5line**, is an R5 release but whose audio is a direct English copy (usually direct line from a theatre audio system).
- **DVDscr** for <i>DVD-Screener</i>. This is a copy sent to film critics, awards voters, producers, distributors, and any other important groups or people prior to the official DVD/Theatrical release date. It often has no post-processing. In other words, for review purposes.

## In-cinema

- **CAM** or <i>camera</i>. A recording of a film by the use of a camera and a tripod inside theatres.

- **TS** or Telesync is the same as a camera release except it uses an external audio source like an audio jack.

## Home Video Rip

Most of these are self-explanatory.

- **VHSrip**
- **TVrip**
- **PDTV** (Pure Digital Television)
- **HDTVrip**
- **DVDrip**
- **BRrip** - a Blu-ray release whose source is a BDrip
- **BDrip** (Blu-ray Disc Rip) - a direct Blu-ray Disc copy

Note that a "BDrip" and "BRrip" are usually interchanged in releases without subtitles. It is not easy to detect if it was a direct rip or a re-rip of a BDrip. However, when a release includes an embedded subtitle then it is no doubt a BRrip. Meaning, the source was from a BDrip file re-encoded with the subtitles. Unless the source material also have subtitles and it was digitised together with the material, then it still will fall as a BDrip.

"BDrip" and "BRrip" are the best rips you can find online, provided the encoder used the best combination of codecs and settings. Otherwise, a Blu-ray Disc rip can and may turn out bad or have artifacts.
