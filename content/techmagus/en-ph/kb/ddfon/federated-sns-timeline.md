In a fast-paced world like what we have today, recording events is often forgotten. This is especially true in the digital era, wherein we assume that every piece of information will remain available indefinitely, and archived somewhere. Unfortunately, that is not the case at all. Sites, portals, databases, even software repositories, all come and go. If no one kept a copy, the information is gone forever.

<!--more-->

It proved this when I started this project. There were countless information which are now gone forever, and in an age where words of individuals no longer hold any weight‚Äîunless they are a personality‚Äîa source is often expected, if not demanded.

My desire to change that resulted in the creation of {{% quote type="work" lang="en" %}}The Federated SNS Timeline{{% /quote %}}. A list of the  {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Federated Social Network{{% /quote %}} history, gathered on this page, with links to sources scattered everywhere.

## The Fediverse Historical Timeline

The {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Federated SNS{{% /quote %}} (social network service/system) timeline is a simple list of its history. To put it another way, it is a record of how the {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Fediverse{{% /quote %}} came to be. This is only one part of the larger {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Federated Social Web{{% /quote %}}. For this list, we defined SNS as services meant for posting updates (microblogging, macro-blogging, blogging), uploading images, leaving comments, re-sharing, and liking; or simply, the {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Fediverse{{% /quote %}}.

Protocols and services like {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}XMPP{{% /quote %}} and {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Matrix{{% /quote %}} are part of the {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Federated Chat{{% /quote %}} grouping. While there is an overlap with the {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}XMPP{{% /quote %}} protocol when it comes to SNS, these platforms/software were not (yet) included (e.g. {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Juick{{% /quote %}}, {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Movim{{% /quote %}}, {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Buddycloud{{% /quote %}}, {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Jappix{{% /quote %}}, and {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}OneSocialWeb{{% /quote %}}).

### Focus

The focus of this list is on information with sources. If the original sources are no longer available, there should be an archive via {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}archive.org{{% /quote %}} or {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}archive.ph{{% /quote %}}.

For example. There is some information I remember about the {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Federated Social Web{{% /quote %}}. However, since this information is no longer available (sites went offline and there are no archives elsewhere), I did not include these in the timeline.

There are also no personal opinions on this list, and no endorsements. This list is a plain record of dates with a link to sources.

## On updates

This is a living project. I will update it depending on the new information and my available time. If you have information available, kindly provide the relevant links for verification. If I can verify (rel=me; keyoxide; GPG; and other ways to verify your identity) that you are the developer of a protocol, standard, platform/software, a link is no longer needed (though still preferable).

Corrections would have to be clarified. Like, how is the correction more accurate than the currently sourced information? Or, how can we reconcile the correction with the currently sourced information? Of course, if you are the developer, and I can verify your identity, your information holds more weight (e.g. you prefer your software's release date to be later than the current information).

Submit your information in the [issues](https://codeberg.org/ddfon/federated-sns/issues) section.
