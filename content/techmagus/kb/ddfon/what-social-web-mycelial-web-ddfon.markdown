Have you heard of the terms “Social Web”, “Mycelial Web”, “Fediverse”, “Threadiverse”, “Mycelium network”, “Nostr”, “ATproto”, “ActivityPub”, “DDFON”, and all of what appears to be very techie? More likely you did and you were confused.

Well… rejoice! Today is the day we will clarify all of these terminologies.

*in alphabetical order*

{{% dl id="mycelial-web-definition-list" dfn=true %}}
  {{< dt id="dfn-activitypub" >}}ActivityPub{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-activitypub-01" >}}
    “ActivityPub”, or “AP”, is the protocol behind the “Fediverse” mycelium network.
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-atproto" >}}ATproto{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-atproto-01" >}}
    “ATproto”, or “ATprotocol”, is the protocol that powers what is known as the “Bluesky” mycelium network.
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-ddfon" >}}DDFON{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-ddfon-01" >}}
    “DDFON” stands for “‘Decentralized, Distributed,  Federated, Open’ Network”. It is an umbrella terminology I started using back in 2011. The friendly, or non-techie, term is “Mycelial Web”. If the network is decentralized and/or distributed; is federated; and is an open network, then it is a DDFON.
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-fediverse" >}}Fediverse{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-fediverse-01" >}}
    “Fediverse” is the friendly terminology that was first coined by Mark Eckenwiler in 2012-05-25; [^coined-fediverse-mark-eckenwiler][^coined-fediverse-twitter] and later by Marjolein Katsma in 2013-01-24. [^coined-fediverse-marjolein-katsma][^coined-fediverse-twitter]
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-identiverse" >}}Identiverse{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-identiverse-01" >}}
    Before the “fediverse” was coined, this mycelium network was first known as “identiverse”, and it was first coined by Luke Slater in 2010-03-14. [^coined-identiverse-luke-slater][^coined-identiverse-identica]
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-mycelial-web" >}}Mycelial Web{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-mycelial-web-01" >}}
    The plural form of a mycelium network is called mycelia, or mycelial. Simply put, if it is more than one mycelium network of fungal threads, it is called as mycelia/mycelial. In tech, this is the umbrella terminology for all the networks built with DDFON (“Decentralized, Distributed, Federated, Open” Network) in mind. The best examples today are the mycelium networks “XMPP”, “Fediverse”, “Matrix”, “Nostr”, and “Bluesky”.
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-mycelium-network" >}}Mycelium [Network]{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-mycelium-network-01" >}}
    In nature, a mycelium is a network of fungal threads. By its nature-based definition, a mycelium is a single network. In tech, this refers to networks like the “Fediverse”, “Bluesky”, “Nostr”, “Matrix”, and “XMPP”, to mention a few.

    This was originally suggested and voted upon by Fediverse users as a replacement for the term “fediverse” on multiple polls I ran a few years ago (unfortunately, the instances where I conducted the polls are gone; though there might be copies on other servers). Using that, I redefined it to this new definition in 2023, since the movement to replace “fediverse” did not gain enough momentum.
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-nostr" >}}Nostr{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-nostr-01" >}}
    “Nostr” is a protocol used in the mycelium network of the same name.
  {{< /dd >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-nostr-02" >}}
    “Nostr” is the name of the mycelium network running on the Nostr protocol.
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-sns" >}}SNS{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-sns-01" >}}
    “SNS” stands for “Social Networking Service”, and it was the original terminology used before “social media” was coined.

    In Korea, and in other cultures, SNS is the most common term.
  {{< /dd >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-sns-02" >}}
    It also refers specifically to social network services used for personal updates. (Also see <a href="#dfn-social-media-02">social media #2</a>.)
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-social-media" >}}Social media{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-social-media-01" >}}
    In today's usage, “social media” refers to what was originally known as SNS (Social Networking Service).
  {{< /dd >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-social-media-02" >}}
    It also refers specifically tothe act of using SNS (Social Network Service) to deliver the latest news and trends, often by media entities. (Also see <a href="#dfn-sns-02">SNS #2</a>.)
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-social-web" >}}[Open] Social Web{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-social-web-01" >}}
    “Social Web”, sometimes called “Open Social Web”, is about bringing back the social aspect of the web. It is about the interoperability of the web and the interaction of the people through it. Instead of continually building “walled-gardens” or “silos”, we build an open social web where different platforms interoperate through federation and bridges, while making sure the content is resilient through decentralization and distribution.

    It is also called “Web3” or “Web3.0” since 2007, [^web3-jesse-stay][^web3-loic-le-meur-01][^web3-loic-le-meur-02][^web3-loic-le-meur-03] which has become a constant conflict with blockchain enthusiasts as the latter was only coined five years later.
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-threadiverse" >}}Threadiverse{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-threadiverse-01" >}}
    The first definition of “Threadiverse” refers to the Reddit-like and Stackexchange-like fediverse software, namely: Lemmy, Kbin, and Mbin, due to its threaded nature.
  {{< /dd >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-threadiverse-02" >}}
    The second definition of “Threadiverse” is Meta's Threads platform. This definition is the only definition of the term in Korea. [^threadiverse-02-korea]
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-web3-point-0" >}}Web3.0{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-web3-point-0-01" >}}
    “Web3.0” refers to “Semantic Web”, coined in 2006 by Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, the URL system, and HTTP. [^web3-point-0]
  {{< /dd >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-web3-point-0-02" >}}
    Also refers to the <a href="#dfn-social-web">Social Web</a> “Le Web3” conference in France in 2007 and earlier. [^web3-loic-le-meur-01][^web3-loic-le-meur-02][^web3-loic-le-meur-03]
  {{< /dd >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-web3-point-0-03" >}}
    It can also mean blockchain technology as coined by Etheruem co-founder, Gavin Wood, in 2014—at least seven (7) years after “Web3” and “Web3.0” were first coined by Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee and Loic Le Meur. [^web3-blockchain-wikipedia]
  {{< /dd >}}

  {{< dt id="dfn-web3" >}}Web3{{< /dt >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-web3-01" >}}
    “Web3” or “Web3.0” was first coined in 2007 (actually earlier, but I cannot find an online archive) by Loic Le Meur for their Social Web conference in France appropriately called, “Le Web3”. [^web3-loic-le-meur-01][^web3-loic-le-meur-02][^web3-loic-le-meur-03]
  {{< /dd >}}
  {{< dd id="dfn-web3-02" >}}
    The second definition of “Web3”, and third for “Web3.0”, was coined by Ethereum co-founder, Gavin Wood, in 2014—at least seven (7) years after “Web3” and “Web3.0” were first coined by Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee and Loic Le Meur. [^web3-blockchain-wikipedia]
