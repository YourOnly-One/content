When the place you call home is no longer your safe and happy place but you still hold on to the very definition of home, it is hard to escape from it even though it has become a place of abuse and misery.

<!--more-->

Our home should be warm, full of love.

This is the topic of the latest episode of {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}The Law Cafe{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}법대로 사랑하라{{% /quote %}}).

There are many forms of abuse, most people assume it is physical but it can be emotional, it can be psychological. Parents shouting, for whatever reason, is abuse. Parents fighting at home, shouting at each other, throwing hurtful words, is also abuse.

Kids who are victims of child abuse have never experienced the world outside their families, so they often do not know that they are being abused.

Those who should love them the most are hurting them. Any child would struggle to understand that.

If a person causes someone who believes in me to sin, even if it is someone who people think is as unimportant as this little child, the Most High will severely punish that person. He will punish that person worse than if someone had thrown him into the sea's deep waters with a heavy stone tied to his neck!

Your family is your home. When that world starts to fall apart, most people think that they have been ruined and are unsalvageable.

But the thing is, your family is only a part of your life. It is not your everything.

There are times when you must seek your own happiness no matter how much you love your family. And at times, you must get away from them to figure out a way.
