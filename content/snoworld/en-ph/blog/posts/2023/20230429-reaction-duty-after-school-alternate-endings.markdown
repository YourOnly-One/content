{{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Duty After School{{% /quote %}} recently concluded and it received a lot of negative feedback due to the way the live-action adaptation ended the series. But, are you aware that there are potential alternate endings to {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Duty After School{{% /quote %}}?

<!--more-->

{{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}DikshaG{{% /quote %}} went through five different alternate endings.

1. The Webtoon ending

    I haven't read the webtoon, in the original ending, most of the main characters survived instead of the brutal and senseless ending the live-adaptation presented.

1. It's all a dream

    This is an ending which was hinted by the adaptation, an one that truly hate in any live-action fiction. I mean, why waste the audience's time when it was all nothing but a dream? This route only works in novels.

1. {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Gook Yeong Soo{{% /quote %}}'s suicide
1. The War Continues
1. Killed by the Spheres

The other three potential endings? I invite you over to read {{% quote type="work" lang="en" %}}[Duty After School: Exploring Alternate Endings for the Heart-Wrenching K-Drama](https://www.moving-stories.net/duty-after-school-exploring-alternate-endings-for-the-heart-wrenching-k-drama/){{% /quote %}} by {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}DikshaG{{% /quote %}}. You would probably pick one of those three other potential endings.
