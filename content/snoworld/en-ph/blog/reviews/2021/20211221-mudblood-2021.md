Update 2022-02-06: Corrected an image caption for the character "Kendra Boardman", in ***Mudblood*** Part 3 the character was played by actress Maggie Keating. Thank you very much to director Conrad Faraj for reaching out.
{{% /sembox %}}

The canon and original ***Harry Potter*** novel series centered on *Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry* in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Fans have always wondered since the original run of the books how other magical communities fit in the timeline. In ***Mudblood*** we get to see an adventure distant yet so near to the events after the *Order of the Phoenix* and how it could have had changed the course of history.

Whether you are a *Harry Potter* fan or not, whether you have watched fanfilms before or have never done so in your life, *Mudblood* is a highly recommended film to watch.

## Synopsis

***Mudblood*** is a ***Harry Potter*** fanfilm which takes place in the United States of America between the events of the *Order of the Phoenix* and *Half-Blood Prince*. It follows the story of Muriel Warrington, a Hufflepuff student from Hogwarts, who acquired a very important item which belongs to the Dark Lord. With a very important artifact in her possession, Muriel can not trust anyone, especially not when The Sisters is hunting her down across America.

This three-part fan film was produced by **Conrad Studios** with Honduran-American filmmaker Conrad Faraj as its director and writer. The series stars Makenna Weyburne as *Muriel Warrington*, Angela Cole as *Emmeline Purkiss*, Jazz Securo as *Merlin Evergreen*, Sabré Randall as *Fleur Jones*, Evan Kilmartin as *Alvin Finch*, and Maggie Callahan as *Kendra Boardman* in the first two films and with Maggie Keating for the same role in third film.

## Story

Overall the story was good and there were no contradictions with what we know as canon in the novels. It was also brilliant that they tied an adventure in the Americas, something fans were wondering about since the middle of the book series. The *MACUSA* or the *Magical Congress of the United States of America* was also involved with the usual "it's a problem from across the pond, why should we deal with it" attitude.

### As powerful as Hermione?

What I loved the most was the main character, *Muriel Warrington*, a "British girl" who was a Hufflepuff student from the *Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry*. Muriel is a very powerful witch who can wield two wands and use both simultaenously. It is established canon that spells are weakened when two wands are used at the same time but for Muriel it was just another ordinary spellcasting.

Even Hermione witnessed Muriel's abilities when she faced the Slytherin bullies.

We all know Hermione would jump to the defense of the bullied especially if they're a *mudblood* like herself and the bullies are Slytherin. Yet in this instance, she just stood, in awe of Muriel Warrington. Although I think she was more worried of Muriel when she lost herself in her rage and used dark arts. Or maybe, Hermione thought she can recruit her in the *Order of the Phoenix*. Regardless of what Hermione was thinking, it just proves how powerful Muriel is at her age.

Okay, last one! I think Muriel would also fit Ravenclaw. I would not be surprised if the *Sorting Hat* chose between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, Muriel is not only wise but is also highly intelligent like Hermione.

## Performance

In all three short films, I was impressed with most is the acting. Special mention to Angela Cole who played *Emmeline Purkiss*. She was great both as an Auror-in-training and as a Death Eater Sister, she can easily pass as the Bellatrix of America.

One where it could have been better was the scene where the British representative was convincing MACUSA to find Muriel. It felt like they were practicing their dialogues, the urgency of the matter was not there, and MACUSA's desire to downplay the request was more of words than action. The two characters acted like they were long-time friends from their school days but what little hints about them we can glean points to the opposite direction … strangers outside of their roles.

I also commend the other two Sisters, *Fleur Jones* played by Sabré Randall and *Kendra Boardman* played by Maggie Callahan. Since *The Sisters* was a group of Death Eaters under the command of Bellatrix, it was only apparent that there are members who are as crazy as her, Sabré Randall and Maggie Callahan, and later Maggie Keating, did great in portraying their own brand of *avada kedavra* hungry Death Eaters.

## Production

On the production side, it looks like they used official Harry Potter merchandise where there is available—the Hogwarts uniform, the Hogwarts Houses neck scarfs, and the *time turner* necklace, to mention a few. The wands were also well-made especially designed for filming, if they can secure a license to sell their own wand designs, they should, especially the wands of Alvin and Emmeline.

However, there was a forest scene where the camera was shaking randomly. It was as if the cameraman was running and unexpectedly stepped on stones. It was a little unnerving, at least for me who is sensitive to sudden unexpected motions. Other than this, I have nothing but praises for the team.

For example, the special effects for spells were high quality. Special effects is the most time consuming and takes a lot from the budget, thus the level of effects we see in a film reflects the budget and time they spent on it. In *Mudblood* they made sure it is up to par with the official films, even better in some scenes.

## Verdict

Whether you are a *Harry Potter* fan or not, whether you have watched fanfilms before or have never done so in your life, *Mudblood* is a highly recommended film to watch. If *Potterverse* was an open shared world, *Mudblood* can easily become canon with its good and very interesting story, great production, and amazing actors.

There are a lot more to tell about the characters too. I want to see more of Emmeline Purkiss, she was a very promising and powerful Auror-in-training witch. Who was she? Who was her parents? Why was she easily turned?

Is Hermione Granger friends with Muriel? It looked like she did not come by chance when Muriel was dueling with the Slytherin girls. Are mudbloods always that powerful? Lily Potter was a very powerful mudblood as well. So, who is Muriel? Did she have powerful wizards and witches as her ancient ancestors? Why was she willing to use the dark arts when the situation calls for it? Did she reach her full potential as a student of the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry?

These and more are the stories yet to tell from this fanfiction/fanfilm world **Conrad Studios** introduced us into. I hope they can make more and I also hope they can get considered as canon too, or soft canon in *Trek* lingo.
