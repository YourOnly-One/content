## Story

The narrative structure of Season 2 took on a more 'serial' approach, featuring an overarching storyline that developed with each episode leading to the finale. This was a shift from Season 1's episodic structure, where each episode or two were standalone stories with little connection to an overarching plot.

This change in storytelling style left many viewers feeling conflicted about Season 2 during its first four episodes, as they had come in with expectations based on the previous season. However, the season ultimately proved to be a success, with each individual case presented in a way that could stand alone as a captivating story, while still maintaining a common thread that tied everything together.

In Season 2, just as in the previous season, many of the cases presented were inspired by real-life events in South Korea. However, the showrunners masterfully wove the fictionalized overarching storyline into these cases, creating a beautifully seamless blend of reality and fiction.

## A true standalone sequel

Season 2 of {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Taxi Driver{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}모범택시{{% /quote %}}) is a self-contained story that can be enjoyed by both new and returning viewers. Any references to the previous season were used sparingly as flashbacks to add depth to the characters and enrich the drama. It's like watching a new show where some references to the past are used to help viewers understand the characters and their motivations.

## Performance

The actors in {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Taxi Driver{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}모범택시{{% /quote %}}) Season 2 delivered superb performances, demonstrating the same level of skill and commitment to their roles as in Season 1. Their acting was neither underwhelming nor over-the-top, striking a perfect balance that kept viewers engaged and invested in the story.

While there is always pressure to surpass the previous season, this can sometimes lead to overacting. However, the actors in Season 2 avoided this trap and remained true to their characters, bringing them to life with nuance and depth. Season 2 is more focused on the story arc than the individual characters, but the actors still managed to give their roles with the necessary emotions and complexity to make the show a success. Overall, their performances were outstanding, contributing to the overall quality of the show.

## Production

Similar to the actors, the production team behind {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Taxi Driver{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}모범택시{{% /quote %}}) Season 2 maintained the same level of quality and consistency as in Season 1. This decision to maintain a similar level of production was a wise one, as it ensured that Season 2 remained on par with the previous season. Rather than attempting to introduce new elements for the sake of being different or innovative, the production team focused on delivering the same high-quality visuals, sound, and overall presentation that made Season 1 such a success.

As a result, Season 2 of {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Taxi Driver{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}모범택시{{% /quote %}}) was able to stand on its own as a powerful and engaging season, while still staying true to the look and feel of the franchise. It allowed the show to build on the success of the first season while still offering something fresh and new for audiences to enjoy.

## Verdict

{{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Taxi Driver{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}모범택시{{% /quote %}}) is an outstanding season deserving nine (9) out of ten (10) stars. It was thoroughly enjoyable, and I am eagerly looking forward to Seasons 3 and 4!

Did I mention that there is a potential for a spin-off? One possible spin-off could be an eight-episode prequel, exploring the story of Ms. Driver, the first Deluxe Taxi driver.
