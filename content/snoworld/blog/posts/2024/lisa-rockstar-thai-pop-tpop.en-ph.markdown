{{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Lisa{{% /quote %}}, of {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}BLACKPINK{{% /quote %}} fame, recently released {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Rockstar{{% /quote %}}, a J-hip-hop track produced and written by people from multiple nations. This raises the question: {{% quote type="work" lang="en" %}}[Is BLACKPINK Lisa's 'Rockstar' K-pop or T-pop?](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2024/07/732_377868.html){{% /quote %}} (from {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}The Korea Times{{% /quote %}} by {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Dong Sun-hwa{{% /quote %}}). Logically and ethically, the answer is simple: It is Thai-pop (T-pop).

## Understanding the X-pop Labels

In my article, {{% quote type="work" lang="en" %}}[](ppop-vs-opm.markdown){{% /quote %}}, I defined P-pop as:

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="What is the difference between P-pop and OPM?" srclink="https://im.youronly.one/snoworld/kb/ppop/difference-ppop-opm/" srcrel="noopener" attribto="YourOnly.One" attriblink="https://im.youronly.one" attribrel="noopener" %}}
  P-pop, or ***P**inoy **Pop**ular music*, is all music composed ***or*** performed by a Filipino.
{{% /quotebox %}}

This definition can be applied to other X-pop labels, such as J-pop, K-pop, M-pop, and T-pop. Therefore,

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="" srclink="" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
  K-pop, or ***K**orean **Pop**ular music*, is all music composed ***or*** performed by a Korean.
{{% /quotebox %}}

and

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="" srclink="" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
  Thai-pop / T-pop, or ***T**hai **Pop**ular music*, is all music composed ***or*** performed by a Thai.
{{% /quotebox %}}

By this standard, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Lisa{{% /quote %}}'s {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Rockstar{{% /quote %}} is undeniably T-pop (Thai-pop).

## Addressing the comments

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Is BLACKPINK Lisa's 'Rockstar' K-pop or T-pop?" srclink="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2024/07/732_377868.html" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="A YouTube user" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
  What a legend you are. A truly perfect K-pop idol.
{{% /quotebox %}}

No one can argue that {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Lisa{{% /quote %}} is a K-pop idol.

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Is BLACKPINK Lisa's 'Rockstar' K-pop or T-pop?" srclink="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2024/07/732_377868.html" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="Lee Gyutag" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
  Lee Gyu-tag, a professor of cultural studies at George Mason University Korea, also believes that "Rockstar" is quite far from being T-pop.

  "Lisa is from Thailand, but she is predominantly recognized as a K-pop singer on the global stage," Lee told The Korea Times, stressing that K-pop is not just about the nationalities of the singers.
{{% /quotebox %}}

{{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Lee Gyutag{{% /quote %}}, a professor of cultural studies at {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}George Mason University Korea{{% /quote %}}, believes {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Rockstar{{% /quote %}} is not T-pop because {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Lisa{{% /quote %}} is predominantly recognized as a K-pop singer on the global stage. However, I disagree. {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Lisa{{% /quote %}}'s work should not be disqualified as T-pop simply because she is recognized as a K-pop singer.

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Is BLACKPINK Lisa's 'Rockstar' K-pop or T-pop?" srclink="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2024/07/732_377868.html" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="Lee Gyutag" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
  K-pop tunes also involve creators from different countries, but we still regard them as K-pop because it has other noteworthy characteristics such as business models, emphasis on music videos and the singers' close interactions with their followers. In Lisa's case, she neither announced she would give up her identity as a K-pop star nor changed the way of promoting her new offering.
{{% /quotebox %}}

Again, I respectfully disagree with the esteemed professor. K-pop itself, or more accurately, the idol industry of K-pop, originated from the idol industry of J-pop. If we follow this logic, we could argue that the K-pop industry is simply an extension of J-pop.

In addition, {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Lisa{{% /quote %}} has not announced she would give up her K-pop identity, but that doesn't mean her new song isn't T-pop. Expecting artists to announce their transition between industries is unreasonable. Moreover, promotional methods do not define the genre. Using {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Lee Sooman{{% /quote %}}'s method does not define an artist as automatically K-pop [only].

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Is BLACKPINK Lisa's 'Rockstar' K-pop or T-pop?" srclink="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2024/07/732_377868.html" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="Lee Gyutag" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
  "Rockstar" does not seem to contain the elements of Thai music, he added.
{{% /quotebox %}}

This is subjective. What is Thai music? What defines a Thai music? Who should define what is Thai music and what Thai musical elements are?

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Is BLACKPINK Lisa's 'Rockstar' K-pop or T-pop?" srclink="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2024/07/732_377868.html" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="Lee Gyutag" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
  "It is a hip-hop track, so musically speaking, it does not appear to be Thai style," he explained. "Its lyrics are mostly written in English as well ... If Lisa, who already has an identity as a K-pop singer, craves a change in her career, I think she should come up with completely different music with more Thai elements, such as Thai lyrics."
{{% /quotebox %}}

Hip-hop is not exclusive to K-pop. Thai hip-hop has existed since 1985, predating the K-pop idol formula and industry. Meanwhile, the Philippines is well-established as the first (1980) hip-hop music scene in Asia, [^hip-hop-asia] a decade before hip-hop entered the K-pop scene, and two decades before the K-pop idol industry was born.

Language should also not be used to determine a song's identity. There were and will be K-pop songs predominantly written in English, yet they remain K-pop. Similarly, there are countless of Filipino music written in English yet are still officially considered OPM (Original Pilipino Music).

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Is BLACKPINK Lisa's 'Rockstar' K-pop or T-pop?" srclink="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2024/07/732_377868.html" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="Lee Gyutag" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
  "SB19 defines itself as a Philippine pop (P-pop) group and sings a lot in its language," he said. "But on a global scale, even a group like this often falls into the category of K-pop. This shows that it is not a walk in the park to build a new identity."
{{% /quotebox %}}

Categorizing {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}SB19{{% /quote %}} as K-pop despite their Filipino lyrics only proves that language isn't a definitive factor. What about {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Bini{{% /quote %}}? Is {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Bini{{% /quote %}} K-pop or P-pop?

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Is BLACKPINK Lisa's 'Rockstar' K-pop or T-pop?" srclink="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2024/07/732_377868.html" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="Kim Jin-woo" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
  However, Kim Jin-woo, head researcher at Circle Chart, which collates data to rank music releases, believes that "Rockstar" is more closely associated with T-pop.
{{% /quotebox %}}

I totally agree.

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Is BLACKPINK Lisa's 'Rockstar' K-pop or T-pop?" srclink="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2024/07/732_377868.html" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="Kim Jin-woo" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
  "At the crux of K-pop is its own system of training idols, creating music videos and making songs through 'songwriting camps' that bring together composers from around the world," Kim said. "If we use this system as a yardstick to define K-pop, we can get a much clearer picture. In Lisa's case, although she did receive K-pop training at YG Entertainment as a member of BLACKPINK, that's about it. That is why I think her new solo release is not K-pop."
{{% /quotebox %}}

Absolutely.

## Conclusion

Here's what we learned:

1. People naturally identify with their origins first.
1. It is unusual for artists to announce their transition between industries.
1. The language of a song does not determine its category.
1. Music genres are not exclusive to one country.
1. Music is a universal language. It transcends labels like K-pop, Thai-Pop, J-pop, M-pop, P-pop.

Here are the key takeaways:
