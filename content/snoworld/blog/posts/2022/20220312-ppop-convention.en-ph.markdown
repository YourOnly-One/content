There is no longer any doubt that P-pop, or [***P**inoy **Pop**ular music*](ppop-vs-opm.md#p-pop), is having a major resurgence. Filipinos both locally and abroad are rallying behind P-pop acts in a way never before seen in P-pop's decades-long history—fandoms, merchandise, data fandom, and now conventions.

The Philippines is not alien to conventions, the country hosted international conventions in the past. However, this is the first time a convention is held for music fans. As with most regular concerts, it is all about the celebrities but in a convention, it is about the fans and their dreams.

Welcome the first ever Pinoy pop convention, PPOPCON, where we celebrate Pinoy music and recognize the importance of those that keeps the industry alive—**you and me**.

## What is PPOPCON?

The 2022 PPOPCON, catchy phrase for Pinoy Pop Convention, is a 2-day hybrid event happening from the 9th to the 10th of April. There will be fan activities, highly sought after merchandise, fan booths, games, and a concert. [^ppopcon-website]

[^ppopcon-website]: [PPOPCON]: [2022 PPOPCON: The Ultimate P-pop Fan Gathering](https://ppopcon.ph "2022 PPOPCON: The Ultimate P-pop Fan Gathering")

There are two venues for this year's PPOPCON:

### Convention venue: New Frontier Theater

The first venue is at the New Frontier Theater located at Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo Avenue, Araneta Center, Cubao, Quezon City, Philippines. It is connected to Gateway Mall which will make it easy for attendees coming from the Blue Line (f. LRT-2) Araneta Cubao Station. While those coming from the Yellow Line (f. MRT-3) Araneta Cubao Station can use the bridgeway via Farmers Plaza then to Gateway Mall to reach New Frontier Theater.

## Additional information

Before storming the venue, especially the concert, make sure to read the health and safety guidelines put forth by the organizers and management of the venues. The virus known as SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it produces known as COVID-19 is still a health issue.

There are also rules to be followed on the use of venues, like the Araneta Coliseum, which should be observed. These were put in place for a reason and should be respected.

Lastly, as a reminder, clean after yourselves. Let us be responsible fans if we want to see another PPOPCON or any other P-pop related events.
