## OPM, P-pop, and Idols

- {{% quote type="work" %}}[](ppop-vs-opm){{% /quote %}}
{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="OPM versus Ppop" srclink="https://im.youronly.one/snoworld/kb/ppop/difference-ppop-opm-202258/" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="I'M YourOnly.One" attriblink="https://im.youronly.one" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
P-pop, or ***P**inoy **Pop**ular music*, encompasses all music composed or performed by a Filipino. It is not the successor to OPM. It is not a subgenre of OPM. P-pop is simply another term for the entirety of Pinoy music regardless if the music is mainstream, indie, underground, from Filipinos abroad, or was performed by a foreigner.

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="OPM versus Ppop" srclink="https://im.youronly.one/snoworld/kb/ppop/difference-ppop-opm-202258/" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="I'M YourOnly.One" attriblink="https://im.youronly.one" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
If P-pop is all music composed or performed by a Filipino, OPM is an ***Original** Pilipino Music* composed by a Filipino. We can say that all OPM are P-pop but not all P-pop are OPM. A music composition or performance by a Filipino is P-pop, but for a music to be considered OPM it must be composed by a Filipino.
