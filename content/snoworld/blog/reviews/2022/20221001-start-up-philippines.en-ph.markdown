## Premiere Week Performance

From the premiere episode to the fifth, the actors brought their characters to life closer to the original drama series while keeping the characters true to being Filipino. {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Bea Alonzo{{% /quote %}}'s acting as the Filipino counterpart of {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Bae Suzy{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}배수지{{% /quote %}})'s character {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Seo Dal Mi{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}서달미{{% /quote %}}) earned her the nickname {{% quote type="title" lang="en-PH" %}}the Bea Suzy of the Philippines{{% /quote %}}, and I could not agree more, as {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Bea{{% /quote %}} portrayed her character {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Danica 'Dani' Sison{{% /quote %}} amazingly.

The boy next door {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Alden Richards{{% /quote %}} is playing as {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Tristan 'Good Boy' Hernandez{{% /quote %}}, the Filipino counterpart of {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Kim Seon Ho{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}김선호{{% /quote %}})'s character {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Han Ji Pyung{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}한지평{{% /quote %}}). {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Alden{{% /quote %}} was not only at par with {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Seon Ho{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}선호{{% /quote %}}) in his attractive looks and charming dimples, {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Alden{{% /quote %}}'s acting was top-notch when he captured {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Ji Pyung{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}지평{{% /quote %}}) so well and translated it into a Filipino character.

Another outstanding talent who brought the show's high ratings in its first week is {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Yasmien Kurdi{{% /quote %}} as {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Katrina 'Ina' Diaz{{% /quote %}}, the Filipino counterpart of {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Won In Jae{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}유인재{{% /quote %}}), played by {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Kang Han Na{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}강한나{{% /quote %}}) in the original series. {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Ina{{% /quote %}} possessed the same fierceness and intimidating qualities of being a big sister as {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}In Jae{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}인재{{% /quote %}}), with the added Filipino touch of being *mataray* (blunt; mean; pretentious; sassy); excellent acting from {{% quote type="name" lang="en-PH" %}}Yasmien{{% /quote %}}.

## Premiere Week Production

When it comes to adapting a story to a local setting, it is critical to have balance. Changing everything to what is locally common can ruin the essence of the original story. There are different types of adaptations, but in this particular scenario, it was a retelling of the original story in a Philippine setting. The Philippine adaptation of {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Start-Up{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}스타트업{{% /quote %}}) did not disappoint. In general, parts that should be the same remained as-is while modifying those that fit in a local context.

My verdict after watching the premiere week episodes is a perfect ten (10)! I rarely watch locally produced movies and TV series these days because the plot is usually the same. If it was an adaptation, either the production was subpar or there were excessive changes. {{% quote type="title" lang="en-PH" %}}Start-Up PH{{% /quote %}} is on the same level as the original series, similar to the Philippine adaptation of {{% quote type="title" lang="en-PH" %}}Descendants of the Sun{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}태양의 후예{{% /quote %}}). I am looking forward to seeing the rest of {{% quote type="title" lang="en-PH" %}}Start-Up PH{{% /quote %}}, especially how there were already hints our lead female character may choose her childhood pen pal in the end—a different choice from the original series.
