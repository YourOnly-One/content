<sup>[16]</sup> "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor."

In a perfect world, witnesses are not needed but we are not living in a perfect world, in fact, Sha'ul (Paul) the Apostle said:
{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_verse01" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue-midnight" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Ephesious (Ephesians) 5:16" srclink="" srcrel="noopener external nofollow" attribto="Literal English Version" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external nofollow" %}}
<sup>[16]</sup> redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
{{% /quotebox %}}

Bearing false witness against our neighbors is not only when the authorities asked us about our neighbors and telling them lies. Bearing false witness against our neighbors is sharing a story about them that are lies. How often do we--knowingly or unknowingly--do this?

We saw something and we did not like it. When we get back home or are with our friends, we share this incident we have witnessed and add colorful additions that paints this person in a bad light. This is a form of bearing false witness against our neighbors.

Today, we meditate on the 9<sup>th</sup> commandment, let us think of those moments when we transgressed on this command to not bear false witness against our neighbor. Then let us confess it before <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) and ask for forgiveness and self-control that we not repeat it again.

Shalom my brethren!
