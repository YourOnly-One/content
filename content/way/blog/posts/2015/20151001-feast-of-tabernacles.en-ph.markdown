<sup>16</sup> And it shall be that all who are left from all the nations which came up against Yerushalayim, shall go up from year to year to bow themselves to the Sovereign, <bdi lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (<bdi lang="hbo-Latn" dir="ltr">YAHUAH</bdi>) [of] Tsabaoth (hosts), and to observe the Festival of Sukkoth (Tabernacles).

<sup>17</sup> And it shall be, that if anyone of the clans of the arets (earth) does not come up to Yerushalayim to bow himself to the Sovereign, <bdi lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (<bdi lang="hbo-Latn" dir="ltr">YAHUAH</bdi>) of Tsabaoth (hosts), on them there is to be no rain.

<sup>18</sup> And if the clan of Mitsrayim (Egypt) does not come up and enter in, then there is no rain.
On them is the plague with which <bdi lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (<bdi lang="hbo-Latn" dir="ltr">YAHUAH</bdi>) plagues the nations who do not come up to observe the Festival of Sukkoth (Tabernacles).

<sup>19</sup> This is the punishment of Mitsrayim (Egypt) and the punishment of all the nations that do not come up to observe the Festival of Sukkoth (Tabernacles).

<sup>39</sup> 'On the 15th yom (day) [which is a Sabbath] of the 7th moon [a luni-solar month], when you gather in the fruit of the land, observe the festival of <bdi lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (<bdi lang="hbo-Latn" dir="ltr">YAHUAH</bdi>) for seven Yomim (Days).

Observe it in the 7th month.

<sup>42</sup> 'Dwell in booths for 7 Yomim (Days); all who are native Yisharalites dwell in booths, <sup>43</sup> so that your generations know that I made the children of Yisharal dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim (Egypt).
