{{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}) is an epic adventure of friendship, self-discovery, magic, and love. This high fantasy TV drama recently concluded its first season and dropped a very enticing season two plot.

<!--more-->

Season 01 started and ended strong. {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}) was a story about two very powerful mages who can make or break the world. Two souls who tried to run away from their fate only for destiny to catch up with them. The first season was not only about magic and dark sorcery, it is a love story. A love story about ourselves, the people we care about, self-discovery, life, and yes, people we want to spend the rest of our lives with.

## What is Alchemy of Souls (환혼)

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_generic" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_blue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="" srclink="" srcrel="noopener external" attribto="" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external" %}}
{{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}) is the {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Lord of the Rings{{% /quote %}} of Korea.
{{% /quotebox %}}

{{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}) is a Korean {{% quote type="title" lang="fil" %}}[pantasya](/pantasya){{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="tl-Tglg" %}}[ᜉᜈ᜔ᜆᜐ᜔ᜌ](/pantasya){{% /quote %}}) about magic, love, politics, and martial arts. It was penned by the popular duo, the {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Hong{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}홍{{% /quote %}}) sisters. It tells the story about two souls who were wronged in their childhood and is looking for justice and revenge. Yet there are forces greater than them that may spell doom to the nation of {{% quote type="title" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Dae Ho{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}대호{{% /quote %}}), and possibly the magic users and magic itself.

{{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Mu Deok{{% /quote %}} is played by {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jung So Min{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}정소민{{% /quote %}}), a personal maid of {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jang Uk{{% /quote %}}. She is actually {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Nak Su{{% /quote %}}, the most feared mage assassin and who is seeking revenge for the murder of her clan. However, after performing the alchemy of souls, she inadvertedly taken over the body of {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Mu Deok{{% /quote %}}, who is weak and seemingly have no pathways to magic.

## Story

The story of {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}) was well written and thought of. The world was also well crafted including the rules behind the magic in this universe. From a worldbuilding and writing perspective, {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}) is a very good setting for {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Dungeons & Dragons{{% /quote %}} role-playing game sessions.

I only have two feedback:

1. It took long to address the missing daughter sub-plot;
1. It does not make sense for {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Nak Su{{% /quote %}} to have not figured out who {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jin Bu Yeon{{% /quote %}} is or was. Is {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Nak Su{{% /quote %}} cold-hearted? She certainly does not lack analytical skills as she has shown throughout season 01.

Overall I am impressed with the flow of the story. They jumped right into the story while they carefully introduced the characters and the world of {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}). Each episode was packed with important key details about the story which made audiences wanting more. Speculations and theories were written and majority, if not all, were proven incorrect by the show itself.

## Performance

They all did well in their performances, however, there are four actors who deserve recognition for bringing their characters to life.

- **{{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jung So Min{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}정소민{{% /quote %}}) as {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Mu Deok{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}무덕{{% /quote %}}).** {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jung So Min{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}정소민{{% /quote %}})'s role in the show was unique, she not only had to play as {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Mu Deok{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}무덕{{% /quote %}}) but also as {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jin Bu Yeon{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}진부연{{% /quote %}}) and {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Nak Su{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}낙수{{% /quote %}}).

  - As **{{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jin Bu Yeon{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}진부연{{% /quote %}})**, {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jung So Min{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}정소민{{% /quote %}}) had to change forget everything about being {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Mu Deok{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}무덕{{% /quote %}}). These two characters are total opposites. {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jin Bu Yeon{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}진부연{{% /quote %}}) was a blind priestess and heir to the Jin clan. She is stiff, wise beyond her years, and meant business.

  - As **{{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Nak Su{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}낙수{{% /quote %}})**, {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jung So Min{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}정소민{{% /quote %}}) had to show fierceness. An female assassin who would kill anyone she was ordered to. The most powerful and feared mage. A living weapon.

  - But as **{{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Mu Deok{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}무덕{{% /quote %}})**, {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jung So Min{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}정소민{{% /quote %}}) had to bring to life a female assassin who was absorbed into the physically weak body of {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jin Bu Yeon{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}진부연{{% /quote %}}) which also sealed her magic as {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Nak Su{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}낙수{{% /quote %}}). She had to live as a servant while keeping her dangerous secret. She also had to show the changing nature of {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Mu Deok{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}무덕{{% /quote %}}) as she discovers herself and the wonderful people and world she shunned.

  These three contrasting characters, and one going through self-discovery and building social connections she never had, is no easy task to take on. A good actor internalizes their character, and shifting to two other different characters when needed during filming can be a challenge. Yet actress {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jung So Min{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}정소민{{% /quote %}}) superbly played all three characters. She turned into a totally different character without any hint that her main character was {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Mu Deok{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}무덕{{% /quote %}}).

  {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jung So Min{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}정소민{{% /quote %}}) deserves a major award for her roles and for the amazing sword fight scenes in the season finale.

- **{{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Yoo Joon Sang{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}유준상{{% /quote %}}) as {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Park Jin{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}박진{{% /quote %}}).** {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Park Jin{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}박진{{% /quote %}})! The most hilarious character in this drama! Right in the early episodes of {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}), {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Yoo Joon Sang{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}유준상{{% /quote %}}) already made his character unique and standout. Only a veteran actor can mix together begins serious, dumbfounded, a romantic fool, and comedic, into one. In one episode, I can not tell if he actually slipped while walking, it was so natural yet he never broke being in-character. I would not be surprised if he developed his character himself as being slow, clueless, and a romantic fool. He added that needed break from the deep seriousness of the drama at the right moment.

- **{{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Oh Na Ra{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}오나라{{% /quote %}}) as {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Kim Do Ju{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}김도주{{% /quote %}}).** Then we have veteran actress {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Oh Na Ra{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}오나라{{% /quote %}}) whose character is the love interest of clueless and romantic fool {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Park Jin{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}박진{{% /quote %}}). While her role as {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Kim Do Ju{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}김도주{{% /quote %}}) was a support character (even though she was listed as a main character) she was still an integral part of the story as she is the person who gives balance to {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Park Jin{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}박진{{% /quote %}}) and {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jang Uk{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}장욱{{% /quote %}}). She was the only mother figure in the life of {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Jang Uk{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}장욱{{% /quote %}}) and the lady of the Jang clan. the character of {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Oh Na Ra{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}오나라{{% /quote %}}) made the audiences feel happy and sad for her. {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Oh Na Ra{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}오나라{{% /quote %}}) embodied the nature of her character and gave us a way to feel what it is like to live in their world.

## Production

The best way to explain this is: {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}) is the {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Lord of the Rings{{% /quote %}} of Korea. The locations were beautiful and if those are real, I want to visit it and feel what it is like to live in the universe of {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}). They did not hold back spending on the special effects, they paid attention to the differences between magic and sorcery instead of simply creating generic or one-size-fits-all special effects.

Each scene in the entire drama were perfect, there were no exaggerations yet were not lacking. The focus of the audience stays with the characters and the unfolding story instead of being distracted by the background. It was like watching a {{% quote type="name" lang="en" %}}Christopher Nolan{{% /quote %}} film.

## Season 01 Verdict

{{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Alchemy of Souls{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}환혼{{% /quote %}}) is hands-down 10 out of 10 stars. No. I am giving it 20 out of 10 stars. It is a TV drama that any fantasy genre fan must watch at least once in their life. Not much to say, it was that awesome!
