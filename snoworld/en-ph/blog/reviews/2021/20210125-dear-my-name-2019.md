> ***An hour long web series with simple acting but great acting and directing which captured the spirit of the story and gave us valuable lessons in life and love.***

## Synopsis

In an alternate world, the name of one's soulmate is magically engraved on a person's body and is naturally drawn into finding each other. However, there are also those who are "unnamed" with the freedom to find their own soulmate on their own.

Jung Ji Woo became "named" during middle school but years passed and she still has not met her soulmate she only knew by name. Yang Sae Rom is Jung Ji Woo's best friend and she's "unnamed". She has been dating trying to find her own soulmate.

Will they ever find their soulmates? Is being "named" a guarantee of loving someone or is being "unnamed" and going through the process of dating better?

## Reaction

"Dear My Name" (2019) is a 10 minutes each 6-episode web series which was later re-released as a 2-episode show. However, do not get distracted by it, not every good story has to be long. Just as how short stories can be as awesome as novels "Dear My Name" was as awesome as any other full-length TV drama.

The acting was simple and the production and direction captured the spirit of the plot. A story about soulmates, liking each other, rejections, moving on, courage to confess, and having the freedom to choose who we want to spend our lives with. Having presented these "stages of relationships" in a total of one hour tells us the talent of the actors, actresses, the writer, and the director.

Could it have been done longer? Sure. But it won't be as perfect as what it is with its current format.
