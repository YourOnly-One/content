***Black Widow*** is a 2021 American superhero film based on **Marvel Comics** featuring the character of the same name. Produced by **Marvel Studios** and distributed by **Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures**, it is the 24<sup>th</sup> film in the *Marvel Cinematic Universe* (MCU). The film was directed by Cate Shortland from a screenplay by Eric Pearson, and stars Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow alongside Florence Pugh, David Harbour, O-T Fagbenle, Olga Kurylenko, William Hurt, Ray Winstone, and Rachel Weisz. Set after the events of *Captain America: Civil War* (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.[^a]

[^a]: Wikipedia: [Black Widow (2021 film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Widow_(2021_film))

Due to COVID-19, the premier of countless of films were delayed and one of it was *Black Widow*. Originally scheduled for release in 2020, the premier was moved to July 9, 2021. It received a rating of 79% from 437 votes in *Rotten Tomatoes* and a gross box office of U$183.6 million.

Even though the time period of *Black Widow* in **Marvel Cinematic Universe** timeline is in the *past*, it still is a very important story … and the last time we will see Natasha Romanoff. Definitely a must-watch.

***Infinite*** is a 2021 American science fiction action film directed by Antoine Fuqua. Ian Shorr wrote the screenplay based on a story by Todd Stein, who in turn adapted D. Eric Maikranz's 2009 novel *The Reincarnationist Papers*. The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sophie Cookson, Jason Mantzoukas, Rupert Friend, Toby Jones and Dylan O'Brien.[^b]

Originally planned for a theatrical release in 2020, *Infinite* was officially released on June 10, 2021 through the **Paramount+** streaming service. An underrated movie starring Mark Wahlberg and Chiwetel Ejiofor, which tells the story about two groups of warriors who knows the secret of life and reincarnation. It was based from the novel of **D. Eric Maikranze** entitled *The Reincarnationist Papers* published in 2009.

The action scenes and effects were great but unfortunately it lacks depth. It would be better if they planned a trilogy instead. Even so, the pure entertainment value and the ideas presented landed it #9 in our list. Think of *The Matrix* + *John Wick* + *Assassins Creed* + *Kill Bill* + *Inception* and you get *Infinite*.

***Tom Clancy's Without Remorse*** is a 2021 American action thriller film based on the 1993 novel of the same name by **Tom Clancy**. It is directed by Stefano Sollima and written by Taylor Sheridan and Will Staples, and stars Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, Jodie Turner-Smith, Lauren London, Brett Gelman, Jacob Scipio, Jack Kesy, Colman Domingo and Guy Pearce. The plot follows John Kelly, a U.S. Navy SEAL who sets out on a path of revenge after his pregnant wife and unit members are killed by Russian hitmen.[^c]

This is another underrated movie of 2021. It only received 44% rating from 188 votes in *Rotten Tomtatoes* and 5.8 out of 10 rating from 51,309 votes in *IMDb*. This film was based on *Without Remorse* by **Tom Clancy**. Reviews ranged from "too generic" to "an attempt to copy *Jason Bourne*", the latter for me is unfair considering how the original novel was published in 1993 and a movie adaptation have been in development since.

I say, ignore the ratings and watch this film. Do not forget the last scene.

***The Tomorrow War*** is a 2021 American military science fiction action film directed by Chris McKay. The picture is produced by David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, Don Granger, David S. Goyer, Jules Daly, and Adam Kolbrenner, and written by Zach Dean. The ensemble cast features Chris Pratt, Yvonne Strahovski, J. K. Simmons, Betty Gilpin, Sam Richardson, Edwin Hodge, Jasmine Mathews, Ryan Kiera Armstrong, and Keith Powers. It follows a mix of present-day soldiers and civilians sent into the future to fight an alien army.[^e]

This film deserves an IMAX release with all the sound technologies available like DTS and Dolby Digital. *The Tomorrow War* also deserves a 4D cinema release because it just is not a movie which should be watched on small screens. Not even the best home theater setup can truly capture the amazing production and story, and all the work they dedicated to it.

A rating of 6.6 out of 10 from 180,330 votes is in from *IMDb*. It also gathered 2,283 votes from Google Search totalling to 4.3 out of 5 stars. A sequel was confirmed to be in the works in July 8, 2021.

***Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings*** is a 2021 American superhero film based on **Marvel Comics** featuring the character Shang-Chi. Produced by **Marvel Studios** and distributed by **Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures**, it is the 25<sup>th</sup> film in the **Marvel Cinematic Universe** (MCU). The film was directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, from a screenplay he wrote with Dave Callaham and Andrew Lanham, and stars Simu Liu as Shang-Chi alongside Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu, Benedict Wong, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Tony Leung. In the film, Shang-Chi is forced to confront his past when his father Wenwu (Leung), the leader of the Ten Rings organization, draws Shang-Chi and his sister Xialing (Zhang) into a search for a mythical village.[^f]

***Asian power!*** This is the best way to describe *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings*. It is rare to see an ensemble of Asians from Western productions, even rarer from a cinematic universe based on Western comic books. In today's era where racial equality is big, and rightly so, this film is a very much welcome movie for everyone, everywhere, most especially from Asians (like me). *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* also boasts its stunning visuals and a great storyline about a once blissful family.

It received got 4.6 out of 5 stars from 13,725 votes in Google Search; and 7.5 out of 10 rating from 244,579 votes in *IMDb*. With a reported budget of U$150–200 million, its box office of U$432.2 million is proof enough it was a huge success. If you have not watched this, make sure you sit with your family this Christmas or New Year's Eve.

No, it was not a mistake, this film's title is *Mission: Possible*.

***Mission: Possible*** (Korean: ***미션 파서블***) is a 2021 South Korean action-comedy film written and directed by Kim Hyung-joo. Based on the *Mission: Impossible* series by **Bruce Geller**, the film stars Lee Sun-bin and Kim Young-kwang, following the antics of secret agent Da-hee and an ex-special agent, present-private detective Soo-han. The film was released in South Korea on February 17, 2021.[^g]

It is a story of a rookie female Chinese secret agent sent on a mission to track illegal firearms smuggling into South Korea.

***Rurouni Kenshin: The Final*** (Japanese: ***るろうに剣心 最終章：The Final***) is a 2021 Japanese live-action film based on the manga series of the same name serving as the fourth installment of the *Rurouni Kenshin* film series following 2014's *Rurouni Kenshin: The Legend Ends*. The film adapts the manga series' final arc, though some story elements differ. The film was produced simultaneously alongside the film series' fifth and final installment *Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning*, which serves as a direct prequel to *The Final*, with flashback scenes being taken from *The Beginning*.[^h]

If you are a fan of anime and manga *Rurouni Kenshin*, or *Samurai X* as it is known in the West, you should've watched the live-action adaptation already. *Rurouni Kenshin: The Final* tells the story of Yukishiro Enishi's revenge against Himura Kenshin. Chronologically speaking, they come full circle in this film, a true end for the live-action saga. If you are planning to re-watch all five (5) movies, make sure *The Final* comes last.

***Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning*** (Japanese: ***るろうに剣心 最終章：The Beginning***) is a 2021 Japanese live-action film based upon the manga series of the same name. It is the fifth and final installment of the *Rurouni Kenshin* film series and serves as a prequel, depicting Himura Kenshin's origins as the assassin "Hitokiri Battōsai", while exploring his relationship with the woman named Yukishiro Tomoe. As the film was produced simultaneously alongside *Rurouni Kenshin: The Final*, events in the former are directly referenced in the latter, with Tomoe's brother Enishi appearing due to events that transpired in *The Beginning*.[^i]

*Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning*, while the 5<sup>th</sup> and last live-action movie, is actually the beginning of the adaptation series. It tells the story of Himura Kenshin as Hitokiri Battousai, and how he met Yukishiro Tomoe, the older sister of Yukishiro Enishi. If you are planning on re-watching all five (5) films, I recommend watching it chronologically by starting with the aptly named *The Beginning*.

***Space Sweepers*** (Korean: ***승리호***; Hanja: ***勝利號***) is a 2021 South Korean space Western film directed by Jo Sung-hee, starring Song Joong-ki, Kim Tae-ri, Jin Seon-kyu and Yoo Hae-jin. Regarded as the first Korean space blockbuster, it was released on **Netflix** on February 5, 2021.[^j] It is South Korea’s first-ever space science fiction show. For their first venture into space, they did not disappoint and made sure audiences were awed by the show’s deep story and unforgettable space adventure.

The story started out as a typical Western space scifi. Humanity encountered a life threatening situation and the only way out was up, out there in outer space. Slowly and perfectly the Korean signature in storytelling and plots surfaced up and it started to get very interesting. *Space Sweepers* is a story about you and me, being a human, and the relationships we build in each of our adventures. Our humanity. Our frailties. The challenges we face every single day and how to ultimately triumph (or not).

Can you guess how many languages were spoken and nationalities represented in “Space Sweepers”?

***Dune*** (titled onscreen as ***Dune: Part One***) is a 2021 American epic science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth. It is the first of a planned two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel by **Frank Herbert**, primarily covering the first half of the book. Set in the far future, it follows Paul Atreides as his family, the noble House Atreides, is thrust into a war for the deadly and inhospitable desert planet Arrakis. The ensemble cast includes Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, David Dastmalchian, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem.[^k]

*Dune* is one of those franchises I want to see a reboot or a retelling, it deserves to have a 2020s adaptation. ***Dune: Part One*** was an awesome film but as the title suggests, it was only *Part One*, and it defintiely is. If you are not familiar with this franchise, it started from the 1965 novel *Dune* by **Frank Herbert**. It had a 1984 film, a mini television series in 2000, five sequels, and plenty of games. Not to mention the prequel novels by his son **Brian Herbert** and author **Kevin J. Anderson** and two sequels. In other words, this is a franchise no one should ever ignore.

## Final words

Thank you for reading! While YourOnly.One Top 10 Movies of 2021 is probably not what you expected, these are the films which I believe deserves to be ranked as ***YourOnly.One***. There were a lot of films released this year and it was not easy not to include everything. However, we have to pick the *Top 10* and this was the result.

How about you? What is ***YourOnly.One Top 10 Movies of 2021***?
