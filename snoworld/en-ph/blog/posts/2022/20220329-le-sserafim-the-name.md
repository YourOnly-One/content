Here are the reasons why:

### Etymology

The group's motto <q>IM Fearless</q> is an anagram of both the Hangugeo <q><bdi lang="ko-Latn">le sserafim</bdi></q> and the French <q><bdi lang="fr">les sérafim</bdi></q>.

01. The group's name is written in Kana as <bdi lang="ja">ル セラフィム</bdi> (<bdi lang="ja-Latn">Ru Serafimu</bdi>); <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Sserafim</bdi> is <bdi lang="ja">セラフィム</bdi> (<bdi lang="ja-Latn">serafimu</bdi>).

01. <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Le Sserafim</bdi> is written in Hangul as <bdi lang="ko">르세라핌</bdi>. The <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Sserafim</bdi> in the group's name is written as <bdi lang="ko">세라핌</bdi> which is romanised as <bdi lang="ko-Latn">selafim</bdi> or <bdi lang="ko-Latn">serafim</bdi>.

01. The Hangugeo word <q><bdi lang="ko">세라핌</bdi></q> (<bdi lang="ko-Latn">selafim</bdi>/<bdi lang="ko-Latn">serafim</bdi>), the Nihongo word <q><bdi lang="ja">セラフィム</bdi></q> (<bdi lang="ja-Latn">serafimu</bdi>), the French word <q><bdi lang="fr">sérafim</bdi></q>, and the Latin word <q><bdi lang="lat">seraphim</bdi></q>, all originated from the Hebrew word <q><bdi lang="he">שרפים</bdi></q> (<bdi lang="he-Latn">serafim</bdi>), the plural form of <q><bdi lang="he">שרף</bdi></q> (<bdi lang="he-Latn">saraf</bdi>).

## Why Le Sserafim?

It is in the name.

### What is a serafim?

01. In Abrahamic faiths a <bdi lang="lat">seraphim</bdi> closely resemble humans but with six wings. They primary guard the throne of *God* and regularly declare his eternal holiness and goodness. They also purify those who seeks an audience with Him who sits on the throne, that they may not die from His immense holiness and purity.

    - Their first pair of wings is used to cover their face and upper body.
    - The second pair of wings is used to cover their lower body, legs, and feet.
    - The third pair of wings is used to fly.
    - Because of the eternal holiness and pureness of *God*, and their proximity to His throne, they cover themselves as an act of humility and reverence.

01. In other angelology circles, a <bdi lang="lat">seraphim</bdi> is the highest order of angelic beings, followed by the more popular order, the <bdi lang="lat">cherubim</bdi>.

    - As they use <span class="text-red">fire</span> to purify those who seeks an audience with the one who sits on the throne, they are associated with the colour <span class="text-red">red</span> in literature.

### They are Le Sserafim

Because:

- One seraphim, six wings. Six members, one unit: <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Le Sserafim</bdi> (<bdi lang="en">The Seraphim</bdi>)
- The members were purified by fire
  - <bdi lang="ja-Latn">Miyawaki Sakura</bdi> (<bdi lang="ja">宮脇咲良</bdi> / <bdi lang="ja">みやわきさくら</bdi>; <bdi lang="ko">미야와키 사쿠라</bdi>)
    - Former member of HKT48 (vice captain of Team KIV) and IZ*ONE
    - Singer, songwriter, actress, and model
    - Former contestant in <cite><bdi lang="en-PH">Produce 48</bdi></cite>

    - Former member of IZ*ONE
    - Singer, songwriter, and dancer
    - Former contestant in <cite><bdi lang="en-PH">Produce 48</bdi></cite>
