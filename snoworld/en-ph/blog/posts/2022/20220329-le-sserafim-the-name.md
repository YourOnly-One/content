## What is Le Sserafim?

Short answer: <bdi lang="en">The Seraphim</bdi>!

Here are the reasons why:

### Etymology

01. The group's name, <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Le Sserafim</bdi>, is a play on the French word <q><bdi lang="fr">les sérafim</bdi></q> which is <q><bdi lang="en">the seraphim</bdi></q> in English. The group's motto <q>IM Fearless</q> is an anagram of both the Hangugeo <q><bdi lang="ko-Latn">le sserafim</bdi></q> and the French <q><bdi lang="fr">les sérafim</bdi></q>.

01. The group's name is written in Kana as <bdi lang="ja">ル セラフィム</bdi> (<bdi lang="ja-Latn">Ru Serafimu</bdi>); <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Sserafim</bdi> is <bdi lang="ja">セラフィム</bdi> (<bdi lang="ja-Latn">serafimu</bdi>).

01. <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Le Sserafim</bdi> is written in Hangul as <bdi lang="ko">르세라핌</bdi>. The <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Sserafim</bdi> in the group's name is written as <bdi lang="ko">세라핌</bdi> which is romanised as <bdi lang="ko-Latn">selafim</bdi> or <bdi lang="ko-Latn">serafim</bdi>.

01. The Hangugeo word <q><bdi lang="ko">세라핌</bdi></q> (<bdi lang="ko-Latn">selafim</bdi>/<bdi lang="ko-Latn">serafim</bdi>), the Nihongo word <q><bdi lang="ja">セラフィム</bdi></q> (<bdi lang="ja-Latn">serafimu</bdi>), the French word <q><bdi lang="fr">sérafim</bdi></q>, and the Latin word <q><bdi lang="lat">seraphim</bdi></q>, all originated from the Hebrew word <q><bdi lang="he">שרפים</bdi></q> (<bdi lang="he-Latn">serafim</bdi>), the plural form of <q><bdi lang="he">שרף</bdi></q> (<bdi lang="he-Latn">saraf</bdi>).

## Why Le Sserafim?

It is in the name.

### What is a serafim?

01. In Abrahamic faiths a <bdi lang="lat">seraphim</bdi> closely resemble humans but with six wings. They primary guard the throne of *God* and regularly declare his eternal holiness and goodness. They also purify those who seeks an audience with Him who sits on the throne, that they may not die from His immense holiness and purity.

    - Their first pair of wings is used to cover their face and upper body.
    - The second pair of wings is used to cover their lower body, legs, and feet.
    - The third pair of wings is used to fly.
    - Because of the eternal holiness and pureness of *God*, and their proximity to His throne, they cover themselves as an act of humility and reverence.

01. In other angelology circles, a <bdi lang="lat">seraphim</bdi> is the highest order of angelic beings, followed by the more popular order, the <bdi lang="lat">cherubim</bdi>.

    - As they use <span class="text-red">fire</span> to purify those who seeks an audience with the one who sits on the throne, they are associated with the colour <span class="text-red">red</span> in literature.

### They are Le Sserafim

Because:

- One seraphim, six wings. Six members, one unit: <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Le Sserafim</bdi> (<bdi lang="en">The Seraphim</bdi>)
- The members were purified by fire
  - <bdi lang="ja-Latn">Miyawaki Sakura</bdi> (<bdi lang="ja">宮脇咲良</bdi> / <bdi lang="ja">みやわきさくら</bdi>; <bdi lang="ko">미야와키 사쿠라</bdi>)
    - Former member of HKT48 (vice captain of Team KIV) and IZ*ONE
    - Singer, songwriter, actress, and model
    - Former contestant in <cite lang="en-PH">Produce 48</cite>
  - <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Kim Chae Won</bdi> (<bdi lang="ko">김채원</bdi>)
    - Former member of IZ*ONE
    - Singer, songwriter, and dancer
    - Former contestant in <cite lang="en-PH">Produce 48</cite>
  - <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Heo Yun Jin</bdi> (<bdi lang="ko">허윤진</bdi>)
    - Trained opera singer
    - Can speak English
    - Former contestant in <cite lang="en-PH">Produce 48</cite>
<!-- - Their official colour may be <span class="text-red">red</span> -->

The group's theme will revolve around their name <bdi lang="ko-Latn">Le Sserafim</bdi> and their motto <q>IM Fearless</q>. As the seraphim is the highest order of angelic beings, these angelic ladies will prove they are the highest ranking girl group globally. Le Sserafim will fly high and reach heights where no other Asian idol girl group ever reached.
