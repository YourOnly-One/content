2021 was not a good year for most just as 2020 was before it. Despite that, hope is in the air as billions of people ushered in 2022 in a joyous way.

<!--more-->

The joke for this new year is that 2022 sounds like *2020 too* and that what happened in 2020 will happen again in 2022. But as Canadian comedian Rick Mercer said:

When I think of the past year or two, I can't help but think of my poor uncle Saw. He had a boat with an outboard motor and he was always fussing with it but no matter what he did it would never start on the first or the second pull. It would sputter, it would putter but then go silent. But the third pull was always the charm. The third pull was glorious and that's the way that I feel.

I feel that the last two years were the first two pulls of the decade and this year the engine will roar to life, we'll take off, we won't look back. Tonight is about playing with the choke and setting sail. We're all in this together, we are connected.

Let's say goodbye to this year as one, and all agree that the new decade starts right now.

I agree. <q>The new decade starts right now.</q> Here are seven (7) of the best 2022 New Year Celebrations I found online.

## Best 2022 New Year Celebration

### Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea

The best 2022 New Year celebration is **Hyundai**'s New Year's Eve countdown in Yeongdong-daero, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It was a very beautiful drone show with timely message of hope for everyone.

  caption="With an impressive drone light show, we celebrate the beginning of a new year. And while we all had to take a back one or two steps in the past months, we embrace everything to come. There are certain things to look forward to in 2022 - and with those positive thoughts in mind, we all should leap even higher. Time to take the next step for a tomorrow full of new dreams, greeting the new year, 2022. Because we believe in the better tomorrow. Happy New Year to all."

### London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

Next is the BBC's production all over London, the capital of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It takes us back to the UK's greatest achievements and takes us to various locations in London as fireworks all over fires in celebration bidding 2021 a farewell and welcoming the new year 2022.

Easily dismissed as "the usual fireworks show from the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa" but Dubai sure knows how to outdo themselves.

### Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The biggest and longest (15 minutes and 20 seconds) [pure] fireworks display, and the largest attendance to ring in 2022 goes to Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil! They also earned the most heart-shaped firework display!

The annual fireworks show in Auckland, New Zealand was cancelled due to COVID-19 but that did not stop them from organising an amazing light show, and drivers were honking too.

### The Bund, Shanghai, China

Like in Auckland, New Zealand, there were no fireworks in The Bund, Shanghai, China. However, it did not stop people from visiting *The Bund* in the hopes of seeing any alternative celebration and in the absence of it, they just celebrated amongst themselves.
