The Filipino people are known for finding laughter out of painful stories and experiences. Filipinos do not tone down or dismiss a painful or sad story but it is in their culture to uplift each other and to smile despite what one is going through. What happens when this culture encounters a painful and sad Korean drama story?

<!--more-->

The Philippines is one of the first overseas country where Korean dramas became popular. Not counting the 1990s Korean dramas, {{% quote type="title" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Il Mare{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}시월애{{% /quote %}}) (2000), {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}My Sassy Girl{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}엽기적인 그녀{{% /quote %}}) (2001), {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Winter Sonata{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}겨울연가{{% /quote %}}) (2002), {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Jewel in the Palace{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}대장금{{% /quote %}}) (2003), {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Stairway to Heaven{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}천국의 계단{{% /quote %}}) (2003), were very popular in the archipelago nation of more than 100 million citizens. Korean dramas were so popular that some titles were locally adapted and it dethroned Latin American dramas off the airwaves.

It is no surprise that the Filipino culture is reflected in Korean drama memes. One such example is the break up of {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Woo Young Woo{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}우영우{{% /quote %}}) and {{% quote type="name" lang="ko-Latn" %}}Lee Joon Ho{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="name" lang="ko" %}}이준호{{% /quote %}}) in {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Extraordinary Attorney Woo{{% /quote %}} ({{% quote type="title" lang="ko" %}}이상한 변호사 우영우{{% /quote %}}) (2022). The break up in the series was felt by many fans of the {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Whale Couple{{% /quote %}}, many fans were able to relate to it when they too once experienced it.

This led to various cool memes about the {{% quote type="title" lang="en" %}}Whale Couple{{% /quote %}}. Check out a select few below!
