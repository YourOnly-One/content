In every Unicode release (which is every year), new writing scripts are added in the Standard. As fast as the Unicode Consortium is releasing new scripts, and as great as this effort is, there is an unimaginable lack of keyboard layouts for these writing scripts.

Can you easily type the Philippine Peso currency symbol (₱)? Can you type the baybayin writing script? <bdi class="font-baybayinmodernclub" lang="phi-Tglg">ᜋᜊᜓᜑᜌ᜔</bdi> (Mabuhay) How about type in Paleo-Hebrew (a.k.a. Phoenician) script? <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤅𐤇𐤍𐤍</bdi>⁩ (John)

The **Paninap Unicode Keyboard Layout** ("PUKL") was born to provide a Unicode-compliant keyboard layout one script at a time.
