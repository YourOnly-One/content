Since I got my first ever smartphone, **Samsung *Galaxy Y (S5360)***, (and Android too) I was having some problems with calibrating phone's compass.  The compass applications I found in the Android Market instructs users to do a figure-8 wave.  I did all kinds of figure-8 wave and well, nothing.

Until I found this video showing the one figure-8 method I haven't tried - wrist movement.  It is as simple as that, all I can do is laugh at myself for doing all the silly figure-8 movements I can think of.

Watch the video:

It works for all other phones with compass features like iPhone and Symbian based phones.
