These were the photos I took while testing the camera that came with Nokia 3. These were taken in late 2018 in macro mode in Makati City, Philippines.

## What is a Sunflower?

Sunflower is the common name given to the *Helianthus* genus of flowers. It has more or less 70 species. The sunflowers in my photos are more likely from the *Helianthus annuus* species, the species that is commonly referred to by the name "sunflower" and "common sunflower" by everyone.

### Trivia: Do sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky?

A common misconception is that flowering sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky. Although immature flower buds exhibit this behaviour, the mature flowering heads point in a fixed (and typically easterly) direction throughout the day. This old misconception was disputed in 1597 by the English botanist John Gerard, who grew sunflowers in his famous herbal garden: "[some] have reported it to turn with the Sun, the which I could never observe, although I have endeavored to find out the truth of it." The uniform alignment of sunflower heads in a field might give some people the false impression that the flowers are tracking the Sun.[^a] When I took these photos, I definitely observed the sunflowers facing Eastward when it was 15:00 in the afternoon.
