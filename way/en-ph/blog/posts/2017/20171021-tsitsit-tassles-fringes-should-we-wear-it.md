As an Israelite-Natsari or YAHUwan or Messianic (whichever label you prefer), no doubt there were people we've come across wearing tsitsit/tzitzit. These are four (4) tassles or fringes dangling on a person's clothing, usually placed on their pants, with a blue and white colour.

As a Natsari, should we wear tsitsit? The short answer is, yes, we should as it was commanded in **Bemidbar (Numbers) 15:38-40**. The long answer, that is our discussion today in this post.

## Tzitzit as a Reminder of the Torah

In **Bemidbar (Numbers) 15:38-40** <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (pronounced as "yah-hu-ah"; transliterated as "YAHUAH", "YaHuWaH", or "YHWH") Himself instructed us to wear tsitsit. Here is the instruction from three different translations.

<sup>38</sup> Speak unto the children of Yisra'el, and bid them that they make them tsiytsiyt in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the tsiytsiyt of the borders a ribband of blue: <sup>39</sup> And it shall be unto you a tsiytsiyt, that ye may look upon it, and remember <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤀𐤕</bdi> eth-all the commandments of <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi>, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring: <sup>40</sup> That ye may remember, and do <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤀𐤕</bdi> eth-all my commandments, and be holy unto your ELOHIYM.

<bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH) was clearly instructing the children of Yisra'el. We have learned that anyone who is a Natsari is a children of Yisra'el. The native born of course, and the foreigners who were grafted-in to the olive tree of Yisra'el are no longer gentiles but partakers of Yisra'el. Men, women, children.
The tsitsit or tassles or fringes, are to serve as a reminder to us of all the commands of <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH), to do and obey His instructions, and not to follow after our own heart and eyes.

<sup>1</sup> My son, do not forget my Torah,<br />And let your heart watch over my Commands;

<sup>6</sup> Know Him in all your ways,<br />And He makes all your paths straight.

## But we already have the Set-apart Ruah (Holy Spirit)

True, there is no question about that. **Yahuhanan (John) 14:26** has this to say about the Set-apart Ruah (Holy Spirit).

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_verse01" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_midnightblue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Yahuhanan (John) 14:26" srclink="" srcrel="noopener external nofollow" attribto="HalleluYAH Scriptures" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external nofollow" %}}
"But the Helper, the Ruah ha'Qodesh, whom the Father shall send in My Name, He shall teach you all, and remind you of all that I said to you."

But think about this. Our Messiah, <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> (pronunciation: yah-hu-shua; transliteration: Yahushua; also read: <a title="The Name of our Messiah is Yahushua" href="https://only.1way.faith/p/name-messiah-yahushua.html">Why Yahushua?</a>) continued to wear His very own tsitsit even after He received the Set-apart Ruah!

<sup>20</sup> And a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the tsitsit of His cloak; <sup>21</sup> for she was saying to herself, "If I only touch His garment, I will be saved." <sup>22</sup> But <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> turning and seeing her said, "Daughter, take courage; your faith has saved you." The woman was saved that very hour.

## Warning

However, in **Mattithyahu (Matthew) 23:5**, our Messiah <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> (Yahushua) warned us about doing things to or for show, he made an example of the Pharisees. In other words, if you are going to wear tsitsit for the purpose of broadcasting to the world that you are "holy", it is much better that you do not wear one.

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_verse01" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_midnightblue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Mattithyahu (Matthew) 23:5" srclink="" srcrel="noopener external nofollow" attribto="HalleluYAH Scriptures" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external nofollow" %}}
"And they do all their works to be seen by men, and they make their t'fillen wide and lengthen the tsitsit of their garments."
{{% /quotebox %}}

And if I may add, wearing a tsitsit means that you are constantly reminded of <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH)'s Torah and all the teachings of <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> (Yahushua). If, for example, you intentionally lie—what is commonly called a *white lie*—don't you think that you are condemning yourself?

Even if you do not wear a tsitsit, as some insists that "it has been done away with" despite the verses presented above, do you think the Set-apart Ruah (Holy Spirit) will be pleased and wouldn't leave you or condemn you of your *intentional* "white" lies?

## Conclusion

Wearing a tsitsit is what we can consider one of the least of commands. However, we were instructed to follow all His commands, from the greatest to the least. In addition, there are no verses to support that we were commanded not to wear a tsitsit anymore. On the contrary, <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> (Yahushua) Himself continued to wear His own tsitsit throughout His earthly ministry.

<bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> (Yahushua) taught us to follow Him, in His footsteps, to be like Him. If He wore a tsitsit, then we should too! <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> (Yahushua) earthly ministry was not only about saving us. He could have just headed straight and die for us. Instead, He walked on earth and showed us how to live and how to obey our Father <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH).

<h3>Be Wise!</h3>
However, a fair warning. Let us be wise when wearing a tsitsit. If in your work there is a prescribed dress code, for example in a service type of job like in hotels, ask if you can wear a tsitsit, or you can simply put it inside your outer garment, which some brethren do. Or, if you are going to a country where any faith, especially, Abrahamic faiths, are frowned upon or might put you in danger, don't wear a tsitsit publicly.

Our faith is not suicidal. Our faith does not require us to be foolish. But if it is your calling to proclaim His Word and gift of salvation in these places, then go with your calling, if wearing a tsitsit publicly will help in your ministry, why not?

Point being, be wise. It is not about being ashamed of our faith. It is not about lying (the only way you can lie is if they asked you and you were not honest). Each of us were called to do different things and to be in different places. If it was not your task to proclaim His goodness in countries where you might get captured and killed, then don't. If you are in such a place for work, say you are a member of the press, then do your job as a press.

Think of it this way, if you were captured and tortured, do you think you are ready to stand on your faith to a very slow death? Or are you going to say, "I denounce <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> (Yahushua)"? Remember, we were warned, those who save themselves will lose their lives. Many did just that, they denounced <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> (Yahushua) to save themselves, only to be killed right after they finished their denouncement.

I strongly believe that our Father <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH) won't let us be in such a life and death situation if we are not ready to stand firmly on our faith with Him. Look at Iyob (Job), Abraham, the apostles, and many of the early Natsarim! (It does not mean if you're ready you'll be subjected to such.)

That's being wise. Stay strong. Stay alive. Stay safe. Keep studying!
