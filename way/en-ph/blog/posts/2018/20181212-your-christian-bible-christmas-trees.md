What does the Christian Bible says about the “Christmas Tree”? Here are some verses and a video. Don’t believe this, rather, pick up your family Bible collecting dust and begin studying. Don’t just accept what you’re being told, hearing from preachers, priests, pastors, and teachers, ***prove it for yourself***!

## The "Christmas Tree" represents

<ul class="custom_liststyle checkmark-heavy list-red">
  <li>Ashtoroth, Astarte, Ishtar, Venus</li>
  <li>Ashera/Asherim (sacred tree; babylonian tree of life; yule tree, tannendaum, everlasting fir tree)</li>
  <li>Winter Solstice (shortest day of the year); Yuletide, Saturnalia holiday (all laws suspended; sex orgy party)</li>
  <li>Odin and Thor (December 25th; teutonic/germanic gods)</li>
  <li>Zoroastrianism: Mithra (also known as Baal, Ra, the Sun god, Nimrod); the Star/Sun on top of Christmas trees</li>
  <li>Witches (Witchcraft/Wicca) and Druids (Druidism) still do their "Sacred Tree" practices to this day</li>
  <li>Mistletoes, giving gifts, are also pagan and are still practiced to this day</li>
  <li>Kaballah: Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil; still practiced to this day</li>
  <li>Obelisk: Everlasting Phallic of Nimrod; Nimrod worship; also Osiris worship and Dagon worship</li>
  <li>Christmas lights: everlasting light of the sun deity (Sun deity is Baal, Mithra, Ra, Nimrod)</li>
  <li>Female angel: Semiramis, the "mother of god", the "moon goddess"; Semiramis worship</li>
  <li>Santa Hat: Mithraic Cap; the Cap of Mithra; worship of the sun god; the freedom/liberty cap</li>
  <li>Santa Claus Hat (original): Dagon worship; the "fish hat", the "Dagon hat"</li>
</ul>

I used to believe and practice these things until the Most High, our Abba in heaven, <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH) opened my eyes and set me free. We, who crossed-over and left these things behind, hope that this will be the beginning of a beautiful journey to freedom for you.

<bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤄𐤋𐤋𐤅𐤉𐤄</bdo> (HaleluYAH). Baruch <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH)
