O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.

What is His name that we may "call upon His name"? Is His name the "LORD"? Good Christians have been making "known His deeds among the people" but again what is His name? You work as a call-center agent, is your name "agent"? You are the manager of a team, is your name "manager", "sup", "sir/ma'am", "boss"?

Many Christian theologians, preachers, priests, pastors, teachers, evangelists, teach that the Name of the "LORD" was lost in time. Some do teach that it is not the "LORD" but "YHWH" though the pronunciation was forgotten or lost in translation. This is what they learned from their theology schools and seminaries. A teaching that was passed down from generation to generation that they simply accepted as "truth"; and were probably told not to ask questions because their own pastors, priests, reverend, bishops, know better than they do. Which in turn they teach to their own members and warn us about asking too many questions. It's not their fault, this is what they were taught.

However, the Scripture is the sole authority in this matter. Believe it or not, the answer is right there in the Word! It's in Biblical Hebrew!

O give thanks unto <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH); call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.

Now the Psalmist makes sense, right? He said to "call upon His name", what is His name? "Give thanks unto <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH)"! His name is right there! His name is <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH)! It's not the "LORD" and definitely not lost in time!

## He told us His name

Our Abba has a name. He introduced Himself to us. Just like how you and I introduce ourselves to others. "Hi, my name is Agnes", "I'm Angel by the way, and you are?"

I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.

Our Abba, the Most High, the Almighty, the Creator, was the one speaking in Isaiah 42:8. Yet, in the King James Version, and many other translations, they replaced His name with the "LORD". Read the verse again: <q>I am the LORD: that is my name</q>.

When you introduce yourself to a new batch of employees, do you say, "I am the FLOOR MANAGER: that is my name"? Okay, sir janitor! Or do you say, "I am the BOSS: that is my name"? Wow, time to exit your company, we want a leader not a BOSS!

Once again, what was originally written before the translators replaced His Name with the "LORD"?

I am <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH): that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.
{{% /quotebox %}}

What is His Name according to our Abba, Most High, Almighty One, Creator? <q><strong>I AM <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH): THAT IS MY NAME</strong></q>.

### A warning

Let us not forget the warning in the rest of that verse: <q>and My Glory will I not give to another, neither My Praise to graven images</q>.

He will never accept the glory and praise all due Him to be given to another! To another name! To someone else! To some generic title! He introduced Himself, He told us His name, so we can properly give Him all the glory, praise, thanks, and honour that is His and His alone!

When you wrap a gift, do you write: "To the GIRL"? When you give an award, give some his due honour and praise for a job well done, do you announce, "I want to give thanks to the GUY, for without him, this company wouldn't acquire the industry's diamond client. This award goes to the GUY!"

Generic. It can be anybody. It's directed to everyone. It could be anyone. No one has a clue. If you are declaring his deeds, no one will care. Which is what is exactly happening today!

Our Abba Himself said He will not give His glory, honour, praise, thanks that is due Him to anybody, any name, titles. <q><strong>I AM <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH), THAT IS MY NAME</strong></q> use it! Mention His name when declaring His deeds! Call Him by His name! Speak His name! His Name is <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH) and ***there is no other Name***!

<bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤄𐤋𐤋𐤅𐤉𐤄</bdo> (HaleluYAH)!
