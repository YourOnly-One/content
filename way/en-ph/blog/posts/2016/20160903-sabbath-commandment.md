As we prepare for the coming of the **Day of Atonement**, let us medidate and reflect today on the 4<sup>th</sup> Commandment, to <q>Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it set-apart.</q> A direct command from our Abba, our only Father, <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH), our Aluahim. No man can ever break it.

<sup>[8]</sup> "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it set-apart. <sup>[9]</sup> Six days you shall serve and do all your work, <sup>10</sup> but the seventh day is a Sabbath of <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) your Aluahim; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who dwells with you. <sup>[11]</sup> For in six days <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day, therefore <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart."

We know that there are two school of thoughts as to which Sabbath we are to follow: [1] Saturday-Sabbath; or [2] 7<sup>th</sup> Day-Sabbath (also known as Scriptural Sabbath). In my journey of faith, I personally observe the latter. However, this is not what we should reflect on but rather we should medidate on *the* **Sabbath day**, regardless of which Sabbath each of us observe.

Have we truly observed the Sabbath? Did we rest when in all the Sabbath days that has passed and gone? Or were we forced to do *work*? And if it was the latter, were we enjoying the work or was it against our being?

You and I know that in our secular, faith*less* world, corporate entities does not care what you believe in. Yet, these corporate entities are under the laws of the land giving us the right to practice and observe our faith, as well as, the International Human Rights Law giving us the same right.

As such, many of us, were and are forced to do work during the Sabbath days. It is against our will, it is a violation of the law of the land and our Human Right, and most important of all, a violation of the Law of <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH).

I will not tell you that you should fight for your right and take a leave of absence regardless if you were permitted or not. It is between you and our Abba <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH). However, I personally believe that we should still ask and push for it, and our hearts should not be rejoicing when we were forced to do work.

The world is watching. *They* are observing us. There is no better way to convince them but to show our faithful and true we are to our belief and to what we stand for. Rest knowing that our Father in heaven have the absolute control. If He wills that they do something about it, then that is what will happen.

Our main target, to truly rest during Sabbath day. Sabbath, after all, means "rest". Thus, we should look into ourselves and ask: (a) If we did not have work on Sabbath day, did we truly rested? Or, (b) If we were forced to do work on Sabbath day, were we enjoying that work?

Shalom my brethren.
