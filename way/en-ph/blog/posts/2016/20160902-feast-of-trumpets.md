The **Feast of Trumpets** is ten days before the **Day of Atonement**. In preparation for this day, we should reflect and look into ourselves how we have lived. Confess our sins, and reconcile with those we offended and made enemies of.

There is no better way to do it but by studying, absorbing, and embracing the Ten Commandments of <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH). Today, I submit that we meditate on the first three commandments.

<sup>[1]</sup> And Aluahim spoke all these words, saying, <sup>[2]</sup> "I am <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) your Aluahim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, out of the house of slavery. <sup>[3]</sup> You shall have no other elohim before Me.

<sup>[4]</sup> "You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heavens above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. <sup>[5]</sup> You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I, <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) your Aluahim, am a jealous Al, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, <sup>[6]</sup> but showing loving-kindness to thousands, to those who love Me and guard My commands.

<sup>[7]</sup> "You shall not bring the Name of <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) your Aluahim to naught, for <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) will not leave him unpunished who brings His Name to naught.

## Meditation

How did we live for the past days, weeks, and months? Were we aware that He brought us out of bondage? Out of darkness and into his marvelous light? Or have we forgotten it and lived like our old selves? That <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) is our **one and only** Aluah/Eloah?

How about graven images? It does not have to be an idol of some god. It could be a person at home or in the office that we glorified and idolised. Or during the election campaign period, we championed someone and put him high above the rest. Are we guilty of breaking the this commandment?

The third commandment, equally important, is our use of the name of our Abba, our **only** Father <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH). Did we use His name as a curse? Or did we use His name to curse someone? Simple, *innocent* phrases like <q>oh my god</q> turned into <q>oh my <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH)</q>?

In these first three commandments, where do we stand? Are we guilty of violating these three commandments? Then let's meditate about it today and tonight. Confess our sins, ask for forgiveness. Seek Him, and knock. For our Abba <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) is merciful and forgiving to those who asks Him and are genuine.

<bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) will help us. He has been helping us all these days, and weeks, and months, we are too busy and too worldly that we failed to noticed His helping hand.

Shalom, my brethren.
