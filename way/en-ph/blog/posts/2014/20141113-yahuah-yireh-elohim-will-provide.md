[6001-09-08 Scriptural Calendar]

Whenever I start to think about the future, my future, depression sets in. The sad realities of our society begins to weigh down on me. Low salary, high expenses (and that's just the basic needs) — house, food, clothing, taxes. You name it.

Living is not easy. It was never easy. Back in the days of the apostles, it was already hard, how much more today and tomorrow? Things are only going to get worse.

<!--more-->

No, I'm not a pessimist. On the contrary, I'm a very optimistic person. But I don't let my optimism blind me from reality, that's an extremism and I'm not an extremist. We simply cannot deny these things no matter how positive we want to be.

Let's face the reality. Once this burden is on us, we start to look into the material things. Well, at least for me, everytime I look into the future, materialism sets in. And I don't like it. I'm not a materialistic person, I in fact avoid putting sentimental values to anything, that's how far I go. When I see something, I weigh its value. Not just the price before and after. Not just how long it will last. But its usability in my life. If I cannot see a value in the latter, the price and lifespan doesn't matter to me, it's a big "NO".

Imagine then my uneasiness whenever the future, the reality, the materialism, and the effect of it, depression, begins to enter into my being. It's not healthy and I definitely do not like it.

  Then do not be anxious for tomorrow. For the morrow will be anxious of itself. Sufficient to each day is its own trouble.

On the surface, we can quickly understood what <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdo> (pronunciation: yah-hu-shua; transliteration: Yahushua; also read: [Why Yahushua?]({{< ref "/20160203-messiah-yahushua-yahusha.md" >}})) meant when he said it. But there's more to it than "having faith" that he will provide for us. The deeper meaning, *not* hidden, is that, <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdo> (Yahushua) is fully aware what thinking of our future can do to us.

Worry. Quick aging (look at yourself in mirror). Burden. Facing the sad reality of our society. Being down. Materialism. And ultimately it all leads to depression.

No, there's nothing wrong in planning for your future. But we easily cross the border of "worrying" for our future without us knowing it. When we start to feel uneasy, when we start to look at the material things and gains, when we start to think "I want this… I want to do this…" and we start to get depressed because we realised how many times we attempted it but still we're nowhere near it, then Houston we have a problem. *We are worrying about the morrow.*

Just like what happened with Abraham and his son Isaac in this next verse.

<sup>7</sup> And Isaac spoke to his father Abraham and said, My father. And he said, Behold I am here. And he said, see, the fire and the wood! But where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

<sup>8</sup> And Abraham said, My son, Elohim will see for Himself, the lamb for a burnt offering. And the two of them went together.

<sup>9</sup> And they came to the place which Elohim had said to him. And Abraham built there the altar, and arranged the wood. And he bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on the wood.

<sup>10</sup> And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.

<sup>11</sup> And the Messenger of <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH) called to him from the heavens and said, Abraham! Abraham! And he said, I am here.

<sup>12</sup> And He said, Do not lay your hand on the boy, nor do anything to him. For now I know that you fear Elohim and you have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me.

<sup>13</sup> And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked. And behold! A ram behind him was entangled in a thicket by its horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it for a burnt offering instead of his son.

<sup>14</sup> And Abraham called the name of that place <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH) Yireh; so that it is said until this day, In the mount of <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH) it will be seen.

Forget about Abraham being the "father of faith" as we know him today. Here, Abraham showed he wasn't worried. He knew his Elohim will provide for himself a sacrifice, yet at the same time, he knew that he was asked to offer Isaac, his one and only son with his first wife.

Abraham here wasn't even showing a "blind" faith as many assumed. No, he did not argue nor went through it because he was asked by his Elohim and he's just a mere mortal.

**He knew.**

He knew *who* and *what* his Elohim is and he knew he won't let him kill Isaac. He knew he will provide! Otherwise, he lied to Isaac if it wasn't what was in his heart. And if he did, surely he would have argued against offering Isaac! But not a word about it came out from him.

Abraham wasn't just using his faith. He used his knowledge of his Elohim. He knew what kind of an Elohim he serves. His faith sees clearly.

Consider then the teachings of our Messiah <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdo> (Yahushua), our great Rabbi (teacher), who is the Word of our Abba (father) <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH).

<sup>19</sup> Do not treasure up for you treasures on the earth, where moth and rust cause to corrupt, and where thieves dig through and steal.

<sup>20</sup> But treasure up for you treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust cause to corrupt, and where thieves do not dig through and steal.

<sup>21</sup> For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

<sup>22</sup> The lamp of the body is the eye. Then if your eye is pure, all your body is light.

<sup>23</sup> But if your eye is evil, all your body is dark. If, then, the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!

<sup>24</sup> No one is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and he will love the other; or he will cleave to the one, and he will despise the other. You are not able to serve <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH) and wealth.

<sup>25</sup> Because of this, I say to you, Do not be anxious for your soul, what you eat and what you drink, nor for your body, what you put on. Is not life more than the food and the body than the clothing?

<sup>26</sup> Observe the birds of the heaven, that they do not sow, nor do they reap, nor do they gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Do you not rather excel them?

<sup>27</sup> But who of you by being anxious is able to add one cubit onto his stature?

<sup>28</sup> And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not labor nor do they spin,

<sup>29</sup> but I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these.

<sup>30</sup> If <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH) so enrobes the grass of the field, which is today, and is thrown into a furnace tomorrow, will He not much rather you, little-faiths?
<sup>31</sup> Then do not be anxious, saying, What may we eat? Or, what may we drink? Or, what may clothe us?

<sup>32</sup> For after all these things the nations seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.

<sup>33</sup> But seek first the kingdom of <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH) and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

<sup>34</sup> Then do not be anxious for tomorrow. For the morrow will be anxious of itself. Sufficient to each day is its own trouble.

Abraham's faith saw these things. His knowledge of <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH) made him calm. He knew he will provide. He knew he was safe and secure. That he need not worry. <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdo> (Yahushua) taught us the same thing. In effect, he explained to us what enabled Abraham to do what he did thousands of years ago.

This, we should also apply in our daily lives. But how can we if we are not studying the Scripture he himself wrote? Our knowledge of who and what kind of an Abba (Father) he (<bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH)) is will only come from his Word (<bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdo> (Yahushua)).

  Then faith comes by hearing, and hearing through the Word of Elohim.

Faith comes by hearing. Hearing what? Hearing the Word of Elohim.

And that, my friends, brothers, and sisters, is the Word and teaching he reminded and taught me today, on the first Sabbath of the 9th month of the year 6001 in the Scriptural Calendar.

I pray you are as blessed as I am today by His revelation. Cultivate it and nurture it so you and I will grow in the ways of <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdo> (Yahushua).

Shalom.
