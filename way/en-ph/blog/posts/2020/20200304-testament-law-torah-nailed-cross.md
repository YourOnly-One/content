Christian preachers always teach that the Old Testament Law, or Torah, was nailed on the cross, that we are no longer under the Law but under Grace. But is this doctrine Scriptural? What does the Bible say about it?

<!--more-->

<cite>Colossians 2:14</cite> is a favourite verse used to support the doctrine that "the Torah was nailed on the cross", let's examine it closely and let the Word address it.

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_verse01" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_midnightblue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Colossians 2:14" srclink="" srcrel="noopener external nofollow" attribto="King James Version" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external nofollow" %}}
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.
{{% /quotebox %}}

The word "ordinances" was the Greek word <bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">Œ¥œåŒ≥ŒºŒ±</bdo> [G1378] which when transliterated is "<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">dogma</span>".

Since Colossians was written by an apostle, the way <bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">Œ¥œåŒ≥ŒºŒ±</bdo> (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">dogma</span>) [G1378] was used was definitely *not* the third definition <q>of certain decrees of the apostles relative to right living</q>. It can only mean the first and/or second definition. Majority understood it as the second and equated it to the Torah but was it about the Torah?

Do we, then, abolish the Law by this faith? Of course not! Instead, we uphold the Law.

The "law" here was the Greek word <bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ</bdo> [G3551] with a transliteration of "<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">nomos</span>".

Noticed the difference? The Greek words used were different with different meanings.
<ul class="custom_liststyle checkmark list-red">
  <li><bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">Œ¥œåŒ≥ŒºŒ±</bdo> (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">dogma</span>) [G1378]: refers to ordinances, to dogmas, decrees, of rules and requirements</li>
  <li><bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ</bdo> (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">nomos</span>) [G3551]: is the Law, the "Mosaic law", the "Pentateuch" (in Greek) or "Torah" (in Hebrew), and is also referred to the entire TaNaKh or as commonly called in Roman-influenced translations "Old Testament"</li>
</ul>

<cite>Colossians 2:14</cite> was not referring to the "Mosaic law" or more appropriately called the "Torah", the prophets, nor the whole of the TaNaKh or "Old Testament". How can it be? Remember <cite>Romans 3:31</cite>? <q>Do we, then, abolish the Law by this faith? Of course not! Instead, we uphold the Law.</q>

If Paul's conviction was not enough then let's see what our Messiah said.

Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

Can you guess which Greek word was used for the "law"? If you guessed <bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ</bdo> (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">nomos</span>) [G3551] then you are correct. The exact same word which means the Torah, the TaNaKh, the "Old Testament".

If our Messiah <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">ê§âê§Ñê§Öê§îê§Öê§è</bdo> (<span lang="hbo-Latn" dir="ltr">Yahushua</span>) said so, the WORD Himself, through Him our reality was Created, then there should be zero doubt the Torah, the Prophets, the TaNaKh, the "Old Testament" was never nullified, was never nailed on the cross, was never "done away with", contrary to what tradition passed down to us.

In other words, Paul was not talking about the Torah in <cite>Colossians 2:14</cite>! What was he talking about then? Let's go back to the second definition Thayer gave <q>the rules and requirements of the law of Moses; carrying a suggestion of severity and of threatened judgment</q>.

Read it again <q>the rules and requirements <mark>of</mark></q>, <q>carrying a suggestion of severity and of threatened judgment</q>. What did our Messiah save us from?

There is another verse usually used to support the dogma that "the Torah has been nailed on the cross", let's take a look and study it too.

{{% quotebox boxstyle="qbs_verse01" qmarkstyle="qbm_doublequotationmark" boxcolour="qbc_midnightblue" attribalign="txt_right" srctitle="Galatians 3:13" srclink="" srcrel="noopener external nofollow" attribto="King James Version" attriblink="" attribrel="noopener external nofollow" %}}
The Messiah hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.
{{% /quotebox %}}

The word "law" here used the same Greek word <bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ</bdo> (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">nomos</span>) [G3551] which we established earlier as referring to the Torah, the TaNaKh, the "Old Testament". Let's also bring in the other definition we passed earlier <q>the Christian religion: the law demanding faith, the moral instruction given by Christ, especially the precept concerning love</q>.

If <cite>Galatians 3:13</cite> was referring to the <bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ</bdo> (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">nomos</span>) [G3551] as a curse then it would mean the "Christian religion", "the law demanding faith", is a curse!

Clearly, the verse wasn't referring to simply the <bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ</bdo> (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">nomos</span>) [G3551]. If we read <cite>Galatians 3:13</cite> again, it says <q>from the curse <mark>of</mark></q>, <q>being made a curse for us</q>. Read it again and again. It is not <bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ</bdo> (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">nomos</span>) [G3551] which is a/the curse, it is the penalty of <strong><em>disobedience</em></strong> of (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">nomos</span>) [G3551] that is <q>being made a curse for us</q>.

How did we know that? Let's keep reading the same verse <q>for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree</q>. This is a rule found in the Torah, recall the definition of <bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">Œ¥œåŒ≥ŒºŒ±</bdo> (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">dogma</span>) [G1378]: <q>the rules and requirements of the law of Moses; carrying a suggestion of severity and of threatened judgment</q>.

So what is this <q>rule and requirement</q> <q>carrying a suggestion of severity and of threatened judgment</q>?

What shall we say then? Is the law sin? By no means. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.

Once again, the "law" here is the Greek word <bdo dir="ltr" lang="grc">ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ</bdo> (<span lang="grc-Latn" dir="ltr">nomos</span>) [G3551] (Torah).

From these verses, it is crystal clear it is not the Torah which is <q>being made a curse for us</q> (<cite>Galatians 3:13</cite>) but the <q>the rules and requirements of the law of Moses; carrying a suggestion of severity and of threatened judgment</q> (the penalty of disobedience) (<cite>Colossians 2:14</cite>). The Torah itself is a blessing for through it we knew we have sinned (<cite>Romans 7:7</cite>) and thus learned we needed salvation through <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">ê§âê§Ñê§Öê§îê§Öê§è</bdo> (<span lang="hbo-Latn" dir="ltr">Yahushua</span>) (<cite>Romans 6:23</cite>).

In short, we must obey the Torah. It still is valid to this very day. Remember, disobedience is sin.

For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">ê§âê§Ñê§Öê§Ñ</bdo> (<span lang="hbo-Latn" dir="ltr">YAHUAH</span>), he hath also rejected thee from being king.
{{% /quotebox %}}

He already paid for our sins so we wouldn't hang on a tree (<cite>Galatians 3:13</cite>; <cite>Deuteronomy 21:22</cite>). Salvation comes from <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">ê§âê§Ñê§Öê§îê§Öê§è</bdo> (<span lang="hbo-Latn" dir="ltr">Yahushua</span>), His Name means <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">ê§âê§Ñê§Öê§Ñ</bdo> (<span lang="hbo-Latn" dir="ltr">YAHUAH</span>) saves. All we have to do now is to keep on living by faith for lack of thereof is sin (<cite>Romans 14:23</cite>); and to obey the Torah (instructions, law) of <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">ê§âê§Ñê§Öê§Ñ</bdo> (<span lang="hbo-Latn" dir="ltr">YAHUAH</span>) (<cite>Psalms 78:10</cite>).

Shalom!
